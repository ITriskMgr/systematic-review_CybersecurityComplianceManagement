  abstract = {Service Providers1 aim at optimizing resource utilisation while respecting the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) entered with customers. Dynamic reconfiguration is a mechanism for rearranging, allocating and deallocating resources as workload varies. Rearranging, adding or deallocating resources are performed by actions according to elasticity rules triggered by certain conditional events, like threshold violations, called triggers. At runtime, more than one trigger may be generated at a time. Handling them independently may jeopardize certain properties such as availability; moreover, it may harm the stability of the system. In this paper we propose a model based approach for runtime correlation of triggers and the execution of their related elasticity rule actions. This approach is part of an overall framework for SLA compliance management and dynamic reconfiguration. \textcopyright{} 2018 Authors.},

  abstract = {In today's highly competitive market, where globalisation, mass production, and specialisation characterise the interconnected industrialised society, integrated Supply Chains (SCs) are more important than ever. Decision-makers rely on precise SC data, and even the smallest interruption in the data flow can have a substantial impact on the quality of the decisions. This dependency has inadvertently driven device connectivity towards an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) approach in the complete interconnection paradigm. While interconnectivity between devices has accelerated, IIoT and Industry 4.0 SC security measures have not kept pace. This conflict is exacerbated further by the need to process the data produced by IIoT systems while maintaining data privacy. With personal data being an integral part of the SC paradigm, this paper provides an extensive review of academic sources and consulting reports and presents a comprehensive analysis of the SC management barriers in Industry 4.0, as well as the role that advancements in Blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) can play in mitigating SC security management risks.},

\par
In today's highly competitive market, where globalisation, mass production, and specialisation characterize the interconnected industrialised society, SCs are more important than ever, and a comprehensive analysis of the role of Blockchain and artificial intelligence in managing SC complexity and visibility.
\par
As businesses produce more and more data, it becomes more difficult to extract the most critical information for business and supply chain management. Big Data is an emerging field of technology that is having a significant impact on our society. While using technology to harness the power of Big Data, it is essential to ensure that any Personal Data flowing through Big Data processing systems is appropriately safeguarded. This is especially important in the context of data-driven Supply Chains.
\par
Personal Data breaches, information misuse, reputational damage, and legal charges for non-compliance can affect supply chains, resulting in decreased shareholder returns. The increased complexity of SC systems, the increased probability of failure, and the increased impact of SC failures have increased dramatically over the past few decades. Consequently, it is essential to correctly define and manage SC risks relating to the flow of Personal Data through multiple processing systems.
\par
This paper discusses the emergence of Industry 4.0, the major risks and challenges facing the SC industry, and the role that emerging technologies such as Blockchain and AI can play in reducing SC security risks.
\par
New generation computing and technological tools have transformed organisations by lowering operational costs, increasing product quality, and enabling faster and more reliable delivery. Global competition has also boosted ICT innovations and forced governments to take political measures regarding trade barriers. Industry 4.0 has brought about significant changes to data-driven processes in SC systems. These changes make it possible to track the entire SC in real-time, spot risks, track orders, transits, or the warehouse status, and minimise out-of-stock situations.
\par
A circular economy requires appropriate methodologies and data structures for collecting, processing, and sharing relevant and accurate Personal Data securely and safely. This may lead to new threats and compromise personal data security and privacy.
\par
SC risk management is becoming more challenging due to the increasing likelihood and consequences of interruptions in SC resulting from security vulnerabilities being exploited. This paper provides recommendations for technical and strategic solutions to help businesses become more resilient.
\par
SCs are networks of globally interconnected entities and subsystems that interact with each other by exchanging information. Managing, negotiating, evaluating, and optimising these relationships adds complexity to SCs, which must be differentiated between necessary and unnecessary complexity.
\par
In a holistic supply chain, risk management is the pragmatic development of a strategic relationship with suppliers, with the mutual aim of achieving excellence for both parties benefit. Transparency is crucial for SC enterprises to recognise, monitor, and respond to potential risks. Most organisations lack insight into their supply chain processes, leaving them open to worldwide exposures. A Supplier Self-Assessment is one way to get a better insight of how Personal Data is safeguarded across SC organisations. Auditing can be used for illegal business rivalry, where larger enterprises compel smaller enterprises into compliance, or withhold the right to audit them.
\par
Audits require resources and increase operational costs for the collaborating parties, especially where offshore auditing is required. Some suppliers try to hide their poor practices and inadequate controls in contracts, which may result in customers seeking reparation by way of penalty clauses.
\par
Measuring social performance with social indicators is not an easy task because social issues are dynamic and difficult to enforce across the entire supply chain. Developing effective methods to evaluate, compare, benchmark and connect behaviours to sustainability indicators is essential for any sustainability program's success. In the UK and internationally, firms are unwilling to allocate money to the social performance management process, and this is because of high delivery expectations. However, this policy has drawbacks.
\par
The vast economic and political growth has undoubtedly contributed to the complexity of SCs as they extend across more international borders. Natural disasters, political turmoil, piracy and regional economic crises now affect interconnected SC entities directly and indirectly. In an age of intense diversity and uncertainty, firms must adopt effective risk management mitigation strategies to increase resilience against supply chain risks. This requires radical strategic decisions and a change in the operating model and organisational structure. A robust Supply Chain Security Assurance Programme is essential to protect an organisation's information assets, including Personal Data. The Programme must be communicated and acknowledged with the SC partners and include an Early Supply Involvement (ESI) practice.
\par
SCs are faced with security threats at any given time from internal threat actors (employees) or external threat actors (Foreign Intelligence Services, Organized Crime, Hackers, etc.). Such attacks may generate significant issues for companies or even put them at risk of bankruptcy.
\par
Different data types reside in many places in a data-driven SC, and their protection depends on a combination of encryption, integrity protection, and data loss prevention techniques. Some companies fail to identify and isolate their most valuable information assets from less business-critical and publicly available information on their internal networks. To protect data, organisations should consider the value of their data assets and the restrictions that must be applied to their access and use. They should create a data inventory or map according to the data's applications, and implement different security controls according to their classification.
\par
Many organisations rely on COTS products from countries with different legal and regulatory measures and data protection restrictions. Standardisation could help avoid uncertainty and curb potential exploitation by suppliers by improving transparency and permission requirements, and by increasing accountability and predictability.
\par
Gruschka states that privacy issues cause alarm in data driven SCs due to the requirement to store, process and often share large volumes of information. Companies should ensure that contracts contain clauses that safeguard personal data and conduct regular vendor risk assessments. Companies face challenges in using SC management data to avoid legal issue related to personal data and privacy violations. In addition, SC management data may contain personally identifiable information (PII) or private information, which must remain protected.
\par
The COVID-19 pandemic exposed most organisations' SC risk management weaknesses, and many companies reported negative or economic solid impacts on their businesses. Governments have provided treatment for infected employees and financial support for industrial firm's sustainability.
\par
IIoT and Blockchain technologies can be used to develop a fully trusted supply chain network for accurate risk assessments and quantification tools, and can improve transparency and visibility of SC management data flow, process automation, eliminate intermediaries, and enable real-time tracking. Blockchain is an innovative concept that stores all transactions in a decentralised distributed ledger within the communication environment. This ledger is protected by strong cryptographic protection and offers an immutable audit trail and transaction history for all the different data levels accessed modified within the SC environment. Blockchain technology can be used to manage SC in Industry 4.0 by creating distributed ledgers comprised of various data structures essential to SC management. However, the size of the data required to be stored together with existing searching capabilities offered by Blockchain might conflict with the UK GDPR. The deployment of Blockchain technology must consider specific privacy issues linked to extant ICT systems, and viewing and retrieval permissions are often complicated to establish on the premise that different SC members frequently share data processing and viewership.
\par
Big-Data based IIoT systems collect large amounts of data from sensors and process them in centralised servers. However, attackers may gain access to the generated data during training, which can be used to launch physical cyber-attacks against industrial control systems. Federated Learning works in different network topologies, including centralised, clustered, and wholly distributed. The latter has the advantage of better scalability and avoids a single point of failure.
\par
SC has been undergoing tremendous changes over the last few decades, moving away from purely operational logistics activities and towards automated end-to-end data-driven processes. Data has become the most critical resource for many modern companies.},

  abstract = {Much research is ongoing to assess and improve compliance to laws and regulations. As this domain continues to grow and mature, and with more modelling methods introduced to support compliance tasks, important questions need to be asked. What exactly are these methods used for? Where have they been applied? What benefits do they offer? This paper explores how goal-oriented and non-goal-oriented modelling methods have been used for legal and regulatory compliance, and identifies their main claimed benefits and drawbacks based on the kind of compliance tasks they perform. Using a systematic literature mapping approach, we evaluated 103 articles describing the use of modelling methods obtained from a pool of 286 articles. The results indicate that modelling methods focus on the intent of a law, but goal-oriented modelling methods do so while also reflecting the structure of a law, generally with substantial benefits for all compliance tasks. In addition, whereas modelling methods are used for compliance modelling, checking, analysis and enactment tasks, our analysis indicates that the coverage of these methods is more frequent in the healthcare domain with 55\% of the articles reviewed targeting it. In terms of the contexts modelling methods address, privacy has the highest level of attention with a focus from 54\% of the reviewed articles. The articles reviewed revealed a total of 60 different laws and regulations from 14 different countries, with 62\% focusing on privacy. Moreover, while 82\% of the articles reviewed addressed concerns of regulated parties, only 12\% addressed the concerns of regulators, and 6\% addressed concerns of both regulating and regulated parties. This study highlights the benefits and drawbacks of both types of~modelling methods and identifies potential benefits and common drawbacks that will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in the selection of modelling methods or in the identification of selection criteria. Finally, the mapping results emphasize the need for more studies outside of healthcare, that are related to contexts other than privacy, that target compliance enactment tasks or that take the concerns of regulators into consideration.},

This paper explores how modelling methods have been used for legal and regulatory compliance, and identifies the main claimed benefits and drawbacks based on the kind of compliance tasks they perform. It also highlights the need for more studies outside of healthcare, that target compliance enactment tasks.
\par
Regulatory compliance is the act of ensuring adherence to laws, guidelines, specifications and regulations. It is prompted by concerns about security, privacy, climate change, business fairness, competitiveness and innovation.
\par
Goal-oriented methods are based on the use of models composed of goals from various stakeholders and their relationships, including AND/OR decompositions and positive/negative contributions. These methods are used to structure requirements according to their contributions towards achieving the goals of various stakeholders.
\par
Activities in compliance with laws or regulations include modelling, checking, analysis and enactment. Models are used to describe compliance requirements, checking tasks ensure that the models capture correctly the requirements, analysis tasks provide insight into the compliance of an organization, process, product, etc., with the laws or regulations.
\par
Different contexts exist that require legal or regulatory compliance. Methods are used to address these contexts and the resulting analysis identifies claimed benefits and drawbacks reported in the requirements engineering articles we reviewed.
\par
This review focuses on the benefits and drawbacks of goal-oriented and non-goal-oriented modelling methods for common compliance tasks. It also identifies domains and contexts of applications that require more attention in the future.
\par
This study describes how to use a systematic literature mapping method to identify benefits of using modelling methods.
\par
We used a systematic literature mapping to explore the use, and benefits or drawbacks of goal and non-goal-oriented modelling methods. The method is based on Kitchenham's systematic literature review methodology and Peterson et al.'s suggestions on systematic literature mapping.
\par
A systematic literature review/mapping study is conducted in three stages. The first stage involves selecting articles to review.
\par
To identify the use and compare the benefits and drawbacks of goal-oriented and non-goal-oriented modelling methods for legal and regulatory compliance, we defined three research questions, a search strategy and inclusion and exclusion criteria, and searched for articles using these criteria.
\par
We identified four major databases in information systems, computer science and engineering that address legal and regulatory compliance. We also identified twelve conference venues that publish methods related to legal or regulatory compliance, and a comprehensive examination of different types of Information Technology artefacts used in legal or regulatory compliance.
\par
We selected articles that addressed the use of modelling methods for compliance modelling, checking, analysis or enactment, and that also included evidence of application to real laws or regulations.
\par
We searched for articles that addressed the three research questions using three search strategies and removed duplicates to obtain 70 articles.
\par
We searched 13 venues for papers on legal compliance in conference proceedings and 13 journals, including Journal of Systems and Software, Requirements Engineering Journal, Transactions on Software Engineering, International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Information and Software Technology Journal.
\par
The search for articles on compliance returned 286 articles. Of these, 103 articles were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and each paper includes a brief description of the method, compliance context, and domain covered.
\par
This stage presents results from the review of primary articles. It answers the first research question.
\par
A large number of articles were published on non-goal-oriented modelling methods for legal or regulatory compliance in the last 30 years, with 40 articles published between 2007 and 2011 and 52 articles published between 2012 and 2016, inclusively.
\par
The healthcare domain witnessed the highest number of applications, followed by the government domain with 14 articles, the financial sector with 12 articles, the transport domain with 8 articles, the business domain with 5 articles, and the environment, media, nuclear, oil and gas, and telecommunications with 1 article each.
\par
The 103 selected papers discuss 60 laws and regulations from 14 countries around the world. Privacy is the most frequent context, and privacy laws and regulations naturally appear to be the most involved.
\par
The reviewed articles discussed 112 laws and regulations, of which 80 addressed privacy concerns, and 48 addressed non-privacy concerns. The most frequently used law was HIPAA, with 39 applications, followed by Luxembourg Income Tax Law and Canada's Personal Health Information Protection Act.
\par
The 103 reviewed articles addressed 236 compliance tasks, of which 42\% were compliance modelling tasks, 43\% compliance checking tasks, 13\% compliance analysis tasks and 2\% compliance enactment tasks. The least addressed tasks were compliance analysis and enactment tasks.
\par
Two major approaches are involved in compliance modelling tasks: intent and structure. Intent involves directly understanding what the law says, while structure involves abstracting from semantics and exploring intended relationships between structural elements of the law.
\par
Goal-oriented modelling methods can be used to model laws and regulations.
\par
A simplified model of airport security regulations is illustrated in Fig. 6, where parts of the regulations are captured at different structural levels, and measurements are fed into indicators, which convert measures into satisfaction levels by comparing them to target expectations.
\par
This paper presents a goal-oriented modelling approach for modelling the intent of the law. The approach exploits the Hohfeldian Taxonomy to specify semantic aspects of legal fragments.
\par
The production rule model is a knowledge representation technique used in artificial intelligence. It can be used to validate software requirements for legal compliance.
\par
Out of 98 articles covering compliance modelling tasks, 79 articles focused on modelling the intent of the law, 19 articles focused on modelling the structure of the law. Goal-oriented modelling methods appear to be more beneficial because they provide a broader picture of the law and activities involved.
\par
Goal-oriented modelling methods facilitate the creation of goal models for many compliance contexts, and enable the identification and presentation of collections of related laws as families of goal models, leading to better reusability and customization across different domains and contexts.
\par
Compliance checking ensures that models correspond to the relevant parts of laws and regulations through validation and verification activities. This is done with goal-oriented modelling, non-goal-oriented modelling or the integration of both methods.
\par
43 articles addressed compliance checking tasks, 59 articles addressed nongoal-oriented modelling methods, and one article addressed the integration of both methods. Goal-oriented modelling methods provide traceability links and tool support easily automated for use to track compliance.
\par
Compliance analysis tasks include activities that provide insight into the state of compliance because of the fulfilment or violation of the compliance requirements. These activities include measurements, calculations, resolutions, explanations or reports made by exploring traceability links between models and compliance requirements.
\par
Goal-oriented modelling methods offer more benefits than non-goal-oriented modelling methods here, because they offer a simpler compliance perspective, in one integrated model. They also enable quantitative and qualitative measures of compliance to offer insight on compliance outcomes.
\par
Compliance enactment tasks include activities to re-establish compliance with changing or already changed laws. Only five of the 103 articles reviewed addressed compliance enactment tasks.
\par
A goal-oriented modelling framework was applied to predict areas of a law likely to evolve, and supported design decisions in re-establishing compliance of their software products.
\par
Goal models offer a holistic view of regulations and their compliance status, and goal pattern families capture knowledge about regulations and goal models.
\par
We identified several threats to the validity of our systematic literature map. We discussed ways to address these threats.
\par
To address the construct validity issue, we ensured the search strategy was comprehensive and included articles from multiple sources, including journals, conference proceedings and databases. We also did not assess the quality of the articles based on their coverage of formal case studies or other empirical evidence.
\par
This systematic review identified benefits and drawbacks of goal-oriented and non-goal-oriented modelling methods for compliance modelling, checking, analysis and enactment. It also identified that compliance enactment tasks are the least addressed task in legal and regulatory compliance.
\par
This literature map was performed with guidelines from Kitchenham and Charters and Sweet and Moynihan, but there may be some bias in the application of the inclusion and exclusion factors.
\par
The results of the systematic literature mapping approach show the benefits and drawbacks of goal-oriented and non-goal-oriented modelling methods specific to legal and regulatory compliance.
\par
Several systematic literature reviews and studies have explored methods for legal or regulatory compliance. These reviews focus on methods and guidelines, but neglect analysis and enactment compliance tasks.
\par
Ghanavati et al. [11] compared document-based and model-based compliance management methods based on their effort to model, comprehend, document and manage evolution of compliance needs.
\par
Kharbili et al. [31] described eight characteristics of a compliance management approach, including change management, traceability and accountability, and functionality and elements to check and enhance efficiency of designed laws or regulations.
\par
Using experiences in addressing laws and regulations in privacy and security compliance contexts, Jureta et al. [29] proposed eight benchmarks for legal and compliance modelling, which are separation, extensibility, minimalism, conservativeness, entity classification, reference tracing, exceptions, dialect reasoning, applicability and verification.
\par
Hashmi 's thesis provides a formal framework for evaluating compliance management frameworks, and focuses on the evaluation of several non-goal-oriented modelling methods for business process compliance.
\par
Using a systematic literature mapping approach, we explored modelling methods used for legal and regulatory compliance relative to the requirements engineering field. We collected claimed benefits and drawbacks for these methods.
\par
Non-goal-oriented modelling methods primarily address the intent of the law, whereas goal-oriented modelling methods often address the structure of the law. Goal-oriented modelling methods place different compliance contexts in proper perspectives for all stakeholders involved to visualize respective laws and their dependent laws, processes and objectives.
\par
Modeling methods are used in 55\% of reviewed articles, followed by government and financial sector with 13 and 12\%, respectively. Privacy and security contexts are the most frequently addressed with 54 and 13\% of articles focused on them, respectively.
\par
This review of modelling methods for legal and regulatory compliance provides an overview of claimed benefits and claimed common drawbacks, and lists specific examples of state-of-the-art approaches.
\par
To verify the claimed benefits and drawbacks documented in Tables 8 and 9, and to explore additional domains and contexts, modelling methods should be explored.
\par
Regulators determine whether parties comply with laws or regulations. They can use modelling to improve compliance.
\par
Backs are observed in specific domains, and evidence-based guidelines can be developed for providing appropriate modelling solutions.},

  abstract = {A grave concern to an organization's information security is employees' behavior when they do not value information security policy compliance (ISPC). Most ISPC studies evaluate compliance and noncompliance behaviors separately. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive understanding of the factors that transform the employees' behavior from noncompliance to compliance. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR), highlighting the studies done concerning information security behavior (ISB) towards ISPC in multiple settings: research frameworks, research designs, and research methodologies over the last decade. We found that ISPC research focused more on compliance behaviors than noncompliance behaviors. Value conflicts, security-related stress, and neutralization, among many other factors, provided significant evidence towards noncompliance. At the same time, internal/external and protection motivations proved positively significant towards compliance behaviors. Employees perceive internal and external motivations from their social circle, management behaviors, and organizational culture to adopt security-aware behaviors. Deterrence techniques, management behaviors, culture, and information security awareness play a vital role in transforming employees' noncompliance into compliance behaviors. This SLR's motivation is to synthesize the literature on ISPC and ISB, identifying the behavioral transformation process from noncompliance to compliance. This SLR contributes to information system security literature by providing a behavior transformation process model based on the existing ISPC literature.},

\par
In today's hyperconnected world, 70\% of incidents happen due to human negligence, and 43\% of incidents are due to employees' behavior. The National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) provides guidelines to mitigate organizational information security threats.
\par
Organizations use multiple information security management standards, and should consider establishing information security standards for best practices. These guidelines and policies provide the best direction for information security, but there are behavioral issues in adapting the standards, and organizations should focus on their internal problems while designing an information security policy.
\par
Numerous researchers have tried to provide solutions for information security policy compliance (ISPC). Researchers have found that effective security management, proper security awareness, a good security culture, and other behavioral factors enhance employee ISP compliance.
\par
Several psychological theories have been proposed to cover different aspects of human behavior, and many gaps remain open when assessing individuals' behaviors towards information security policies.
\par
Similarly, in [24], the authors described the reasons for inconsistent outcomes for protection motivation theory in IS research, and stated that researchers must use core and full constructs of protection motivation theories in a correct manner for measuring protection motivation behaviors.
\par
This paper aims to develop a process model for information security behavior transformation by systematically reviewing studies published in the last decade and analyzing the available literature.
\par
In order to develop a process model, process management is deemed as the next crucial step. In this paper, the authors use BPMN to model the behavior of information security managers towards security policy compliance/noncompliance.
\par
Section 2 describes the related literature and its limitations, and Section 4 shows a detailed evaluation of the literature review results.
\par
A significant body of research has discussed various information security policy compliance/noncompliance behaviors. Some studies provided composite information security compliance frameworks with previous literature, and some researchers enhanced the body of knowledge by providing taxonomies of information security behaviors.
\par
Information security behavior comprises many psychological components. Many researchers have examined information security behavior with the help of psychological theories, and presented helpful solutions towards the information security policy compliance (ISPC).
\par
Researchers have established that protection motivations upon information security behavior depend on the perceived protection motivations. A good information security culture is created by enhancing information security awareness among employees.
\par
Besides enhancing compliance behavior, it is also essential to evaluate the causes and solutions of noncompliant behavior, such as stress caused by security requirements, injustice in the workplace, and neutralization techniques used by employees to justify their criminal activities.
\par
Most researchers provided solutions for noncompliant behavior with criminological theories, but many argued that punishments and deterrence are not always the right way to mitigate noncompliance.
\par
The current systematic literature review is among the reviews on information security behavior and information security policy compliance. The existing studies are either providing insights into components that influence information security policy compliance or examine behavioral theories.
\par
Several systematic literature reviews have been performed on deterrence theory and its implications towards information systems literature. However, none of the previous systematic literature reviews have simultaneously integrated theory and components to design a behavior transformation process.
\par
This study systematically reviewed the existing literature on compliance and noncompliance to develop a behavior transformation process that helps information security researchers and managers understand what causes noncompliance and what strategies enhance compliance behaviors.
\par
The authors followed the grounded theory approach for this systematic literature review.
\par
A review plan has been designed and research questions formulated to extend the investigation into behavioral factors that influence information security policy compliance and noncompliance. The search scope has been defined and restricted to computer science, social science, information systems, and information security (behavioral aspect).
\par
Eighty studies were selected for review, of which 41 were excluded due to duplication, 215 were rejected after reading the abstract, and 258 were rejected after a full read by two experts with reasons.
\par
80 studies were selected after applying the selection criteria to 514 downloaded articles. Two experts reviewed the remaining 258 papers and added two papers from references.
\par
Results show that national culture, protection motivations, security awareness, culture, social behaviors, management behaviors, and actual compliance effects on employees' compliance to information security policies.
\par
The results of the studies show that national culture, protection motivations, security awareness, culture, social behaviors, management behaviors, and actual compliance effects influence information security policy compliance.
\par
The 80 studies were coded by open coding and the results are presented in detail.
\par
This section discusses the supportive factors that influence employees' compliance to information security policies.
\par
National culture influences human compliance towards ISB. US employees are more adaptive towards security policies and procedures than Irish employees.
\par
Motivation plays a vital role in the behaviors of employees. Various psychology researchers have examined the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation models for ISB and concluded that intrinsic motivations affect ISB towards ISPC more significantly than extrinsic motivations.
\par
Employees with higher perceived protection motivations are likely to have higher compliance behaviors towards information security policies. Factors such as self-efficacy, attitude toward compliance, subjective norms, response efficacy, and perceived vulnerability positively influence ISP behavioral compliance.
\par
The insiders' behavior research was mainly examined with the help of PMT. Similarly, [24,37] discussed the use of core and complete PMT elements for measuring protection motivated behaviors (PMB) and concluded that full use of PMT (fear appeals and maladaptive rewards) has better results on security-related behaviors.
\par
Information security adaptation and continuance is the reflection of perceived motivated behavior. In this study, it was shown that changing or updating in security policy or procedures makes the continuance of protective security behavior difficult, although self-efficacy, perceived threat severity, and perceived threat susceptibility significantly affect employees' continue protective behaviors.
\par
A study conducted by [66] examined IT employees' behavior towards information security. The study found that self-efficacy and perceived effect are the best predictors of IT employees' ISPC, while punishments for peer pressures, sanctions, and top management supervision do not matter in this context.
\par
Organization management enhances security-aware behaviors of employees, which later guarantee good security culture. Research shows that employees' knowledge and skills significantly affect ISP compliance and develop a good security culture, and top management should play its role in cultivating good security culture.
\par
References [68,47] argued that different levels of knowledge about ISP influence behavioral compliance. However, 80 percent of respondents showed their intention to comply with ISP.
\par
Researchers focused on early conformance with updated ISP and identified competencies (knowledge and skills) related to ISP compliance. The findings revealed that most behavioral theories imply that compliance with ISP needs specific competencies, but professional frameworks lack the ability to present those competencies.
\par
The information security of any organization depends on the management behaviors towards information security policy implementation. Several studies have shown that organizational norms, moral obligation, and attitude toward computer security behavior have significant effects on employees' behavioral intentions.
\par
The status of an employee affects his perceived behavioral control over interactive security threats and controls, including tailgating. Employees with more control over their coworkers have positive perceived behavioral control effects on tailgating.
\par
The psychological contract is an essential factor in ISP compliant behavior. The psychological contract has more significant effects on manager groups than employees.
\par
The authors examined the effects of corporate social responsibility on employees' information security behavior. They concluded that only the moral dimension of corporate social responsibility has significance towards information security behavior, and that the cost of compliance has no effect on employees' information security behavior.
\par
Organizations mainly invest in technical solutions for information security, whereas information security is a multidimensional problem (i.e., technical and behavioral). Multiple researchers provided technical solutions for employees' social factors, such as cyber deception.
\par
Employees seek help and guidance from their social circle, and they often adopt behaviors from their peers or coworkers. Socialization and individual factors (computer self-efficacy, personal innovativeness, IS perception) have positive effects on ISB towards ISPC.
\par
Information security controls (i.e., social and formal) can improve information security behaviors. The results showed that formal controls with social control improved information security behaviors, and that personal norms are essential predictors of information security compliant behavior.
\par
[85] analyzed the social bond theory and involvement theory within the social bond theory and found that knowledge sharing and collaboration increased awareness among employees.
\par
A research framework for reducing insider threats has been proposed by [86]. The researchers proposed elements of Situational Crime Prevention Theory (SCPT) and Social Bond Theory (SBT) to help positively promote the negative attitude towards security misbehavior and intention.
\par
Most ISPC studies evaluated employees' intentions, but few evaluated employees' actual behaviors towards ISP. The results suggested that PMT constructs (threat appraisal self-efficacy response efficacy) and visibility positively affect employees' intention to comply with ISP.
\par
According to a literature review, protection motivation, sanctions, perceived behavioral control and subjective norms affect behavioral intent, and behavioral intent determines actual behavior. The TPB predictors have different effects on different types of dysfunctional security behaviors, and intention is the strongest predictor of actual behavior.
\par
Studies have shown that behavioral factors can influence employees' noncompliance with information security policies.
\par
Employees sometimes neutralize the values that prohibit them from violating ISP, and security-related stress causes deliberate misbehavior. The study found that neutralization is the significant predictor of ISP violation, whereas formal and informal sanctions and shame have no effects on ISP violation intention.
\par
Reference [52] argued that workplace-related factors affect security behavior. They suggested that security-related requirements should not be a burden to the employees, and that requirements should be easy to understand.
\par
Organizational injustice affects employees' computer abusive behaviors with moderating effects of neutralization and deterrence. Employees rationalize their abusive actions with neutralization techniques, and perceived sanction certainty significantly influences employees' abusive behaviors towards ISP.
\par
References [12, 98] and [11] explored the daily basis effects of SRS on ISP compliance. These researchers found that daily work stress, positive affect, negative affect, and computer monitoring influence compliance attitude towards compliance behavior daily.
\par
An ethical work climate, neutralization, and beliefs influence ISP employees' noncompliance behavior. The neutralization of noncompliance and the perceived cost of compliance significantly affect ISP employees' noncompliance behavior.
\par
This study examined the influence of culture, deterrence, shame, neutralization, and moral beliefs on ISP compliance. It demonstrated that cross-cultural factors were not significant towards deterrence, whereas shame, neutralization, and moral beliefs significantly affected ISP non-compliance across all global cultures.
\par
Employees develop preference-based conflicts towards ISP, and engage in noncompliant behavior because of their risk perceptions and task completion impediments. Self-justification and sunk cost are the main influential factors for engaging in noncompliant behavior towards ISP.
\par
An empirical study examining ISP noncompliance behavior with PMT and IT vision conflict found that PMT constructs had significant effects on ISP noncompliance behaviors. References [101, 102] discussed the reasons for employees' less effortful behaviors towards information security tasks.
\par
Employees with high organizational value identification are more likely to develop long-term orientation (LTO) behavior. LTO negatively affects CDISV intention.
\par
Researchers have used deterrence techniques to enforce ISP compliance and deter noncompliance behaviors for many decades, but the results are inconsistent. Researchers suggest that when using the deterrence approach towards ISB, one must consider methodological and substantive issues and contingency variables.
\par
A study was performed to determine safe information security behavior. The results showed that if an employee knows the harmful effects of his actions, the severity of the threat, the fear of getting caught, and the severity of punishment, he/she will have safe information security behavior.
\par
A study by [23] found that punishment and sanctions positively affect employees' norms, which decrease resistance behavior towards ISP compliance. Deterrence theory also has significant effects on norms, which substantially influences ISP compliance behavior.
\par
Studies show that sanctions severity and certainty positively influence noncompliance with internal standards of conduct (ISPs). Furthermore, deterrence effects vary with different organizational cultures and the methodological choices of behavior measurement are not the cause of the variance in the findings.
\par
The current systematic literature review has highlighted the information security behavior, its factors, and its theoretical implications towards information security policy compliance. The transformation process from non-compliance behavior to compliance behavior has never been highlighted in the ISPC literature.
\par
There are seven major categories of significant behavioral factors that affect information security policy compliance behavior. National culture is a powerful determinant of compliance behavior.
\par
Intrinsic/extrinsic motivations are the second influencing factor in the enforcement behavior in the literature. Protection motivation is the most effective form of motivation to protect organizational assets.
\par
Information security culture and awareness are also influential factors in ISPC. A developed security culture enhances employees' information security awareness, and management behaviors towards ISPC are crucial for improving compliance behaviors.
\par
Security-related stress, value conflicts, and deterrence are three main factors driving noncompliance with organizational information security policies. Employees neglect the organization's ISPs in order to avoid tension, and unwittingly form noncomplaining behavior and use tactics based on the theory of neutralization.
\par
Based on the previously described factors and their theoretical underpinnings, we developed a process model for transformation from noncompliance to compliance.
\par
Information security policy compliance depends on national culture, security awareness, conscious care behaviors towards information security policy, early conformance of updated information security policy, and employees' competency levels about information security policy.
\par
Motivations play a critical role in compliance behaviors. Employees who are motivated to protect assets or have protection motivation behavior are more likely to comply with information security policies.
\par
The literature about noncompliance behavior suggests that employees indulge in various value conflicts, stress related to security, and deliberate volitional behavior. Additional sanctions and punishments negatively affect noncompliance.
\par
This systematic literature review has provided numerous practical contributions for behavioral information security research. It suggests that information security practitioners must focus on complexity while designing or implementing an information security policy.
\par
Information security practitioners must focus on intrinsic/extrinsic motivations, and management must provide rewards to the most compliant employees to promote ISPC. Moreover, social bonding among employees significantly enhances ISPC, and organizations with a good security culture are less likely to encounter an information security breach.
\par
In this literature review, the researchers have presented a process model for information security policy compliance. The researchers intend to perform query-based analysis to validate the process model and to solve the problem of information security policy noncompliance with the help of process management tools and techniques.
\par
This study has revealed many behavioral factors, concepts, and theories used for ISPC in the last decade. The study concludes that management behaviors, security awareness, culture, protected motivated behaviors, and deterrence techniques can play a vital role in transforming noncompliance behavior into compliance behavior.
\par
Some of the recommendations have been drawn from peer reviewed studies, and include a convenient ISP, work deadlines that don't overlap with ISP, training, motivational training, and including SETA programs in the daily work routine.

  abstract = {Purpose: It is widely acknowledged that non-compliance of employees with information security polices is one of the major challenges facing organisations. This paper aims to propose a model that is intended to provide a comprehensive framework for raising the level of compliance amongst end-users, with the aim of monitoring, measuring and responding to users' behaviour with an information security policy. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed model is based on two main concepts: a taxonomy of the response strategy to non-compliant behaviour and a compliance points system. The response taxonomy comprises two categories: awareness raising and enforcement of the security policy. The compliance points system is used to reward compliant behaviour and penalise non-compliant behaviour. Findings: A prototype system has been developed to simulate the proposed model and work as a real system that responds to the behaviour of users (reflecting both violations and compliance behaviour). In addition, the model has been evaluated by interviewing experts from academic and industry. They considered the proposed model to offers a novel approach for managing end users' behaviour with the information security policies. Research limitations/implications: Psychological factors were out of the research scope at this stage. The proposed model may have some psychological impacts upon users; therefore, this issue needs to be considered by studying the potential impacts and the best solutions. Originality/value: Users being compliant with the information security policies of their organisation is the key to strengthen information security. Therefore, when employees have a good level of compliance with security policies, this positively affects the overall security of an organisation. \textcopyright{} 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

  abstract = {Evidence suggests that, regardless of the number of technical controls in place, organizations will still experience security breaches. Organizations spend millions of dollars on their cyber security infrastructure that includes technical and non-technical measures but mostly disregarded the most important asset and vulnerability the human. Therefore, despite their investments, companies are not able to reap the exact benefits from their security investments because of the human/employee's non-compliance with cyber security policies and measures. Cyber Security compliance is the most effective way to prevent cyber security issues and improve cyber resiliency. To effectively comply with cyber security practices and human acceptance of cyber security technologies, it is important to identify, study and analyze the factors that contribute to their compliance and implementation. This study combines and integrates contemporary literature on the factors of UTAUT2 model related to cyber security compliance. The rationale of this study is to fill the gap of assessing the effect of factors of UTAUT2 model on cyber security compliance. Based on this study, it can be tentatively concluded that the factors influencing technology adoption also affect users' behavior towards cyber security compliance as well as the actual cyber security compliance. This study provides a basic level idea to organizations to formulate a fully functional and useful security compliance framework for their organizations based on factors that influence their employees' intentions and behavior towards cyber security. Consequently, the study is an exciting endeavor to prevent significant security weaknesses and reduce the security breaches in the information systems by explaining different factors that strengthen the users' behavior and intentions to comply with the security. This is an ongoing study, and more information will emerge as it progresses. This is also an ongoing investigation, and further results and findings will be published as the investigation progresses.},

Despite the number of technical controls in place, organizations will still experience security breaches. This study combines and integrates contemporary literature on the factors of UTAUT2 model related to cyber security compliance to help organizations formulate a fully functional and useful security compliance framework.
\par
With the development of technology, organizations need to comply with cyber security measures to prevent cyber-attacks and data leakage. This study puts forward hypotheses for studying the possible link between technology adoption and cyber security compliance.
\par
To achieve effective results in information security, organizations must focus on technological advancements and employee behavior to ensure that users and their data are protected. Organizations must also focus on factors that influence employee's behavior, including technology acceptance, adoption, and cyber security compliance.
\par
This study focuses on the UTAUT2 model for technology adoption, which is an extension of the UTAUT model. It will fill a gap in the literature by studying cyber security compliance.
\par
The authors hypothesize that technology adoption factors have a significant impact on cyber security compliance. This hypothesis will be validated with surveys and questionnaires.
\par
This paper discusses how to enforce compliance with cyber security policies and measures in Saudi Arabia.
\par
Compliance is the implementation of cyber security standards and policies by the employees and organizations, and ensures the effectiveness of mechanisms along with threat prevention and risk reduction.
\par
Choi et al. (2018) identified a positive relationship between cyber security compliance and employees' behavior.
\par
The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model is a relatively new model that incorporates hedonic motivation, price value and habit into the previous eight models to explain and analyse the technology adoption process.
\par
Adopting technology refers to making vital decisions regarding accepting, deploying and investing in them. The factors that affect the user's decision of technology utilization should be considered critical at every stage of technology development and deployment.
\par
A number of technology adoption models have been developed to determine how users adopt and use technology.
\par
The UTAUT2 model has been used in many studies to measure technology adoption and use.
\par
Cyber security compliance is a multidimensional discipline that includes technical controls, information security awareness, ignorance of cyber best practices, carelessness, laziness, hatred towards security, and obstruction. If end-users and employees do not practice and follow cyber security policies, the security of the organization cannot be ensured.
\par
The authors hypothesize that technology adoption influences cyber security compliance. They will validate their hypothesis through surveys and questionnaires, and will compare the impact of technology usage for compliance compared to the behavioral change for cyber security compliance.
\par
Performance expectancy directly affects behavioral intentions. In Uganda, performance expectancy is positively correlated with commercial farmers' intention to use mobile banking communication systems, and end-users' training about how to comply with the developed security policies affects performance expectancy.
\par
This construct indicates an individual's belief about the effort or the easiness associated with the technology use. It has been found to be a significant predictor of behavioral intentions to comply with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber security Framework.
\par
Social influence is a moderating factor on information security policy compliance. Social influence affects an individual's compliance towards security policies, and the Saudi government is aware of the benefits of e-government implementation.
\par
Saudi Arabia is implementing e-government initiatives. However, the advantages are not yet taken entirely.
\par
Organizational environment, co-workers' behaviour, cues for action, and the employee's experience with several other factors influence cyber security behaviour. Cyber security behaviour leads to cyber security compliance.
\par
Facilitating conditions refer to the perceived resources and facilities for an individual to perform a particular behavior. A study in Uganda found that facilitating conditions were strong predictors of behavioral intentions to comply with Uganda banks' fingerprint authentication policies.
\par
Hedonic motivation, also known as intrinsic motivation, is a significant predictor of technology use and behavioral intention for compliance with security policies. Six psychological principles influence compliance, and the strong influence depends on the ability to induce compliance.
\par
People are more willing to comply with requests if they have previously complied with a small favor. The social validation rule, the authority rule, the liking principle, and the scarcity rule all work to increase compliance.
\par
The above principles cover social, organizational, and cultural factors that influence cyber security compliance. Compliance is caused by an individual intentionally, but can also happen because of changes in internal beliefs and feelings.
\par
The perception of benefits versus cost affects a user's intention to bear the cost of a particular technology. Rewards are an effective technique to promote compliance with security policies.
\par
Technology usage becomes automatic because of the habit of using it, which is a well-learned action sequence that is stimulated based on some environmental cues and may be repeated involuntarily.
\par
Karlzen and Hallberg (2017) studied 645 white-collar workers and found that habit was one of the strongest predictors of information security policy compliance.
\par
Niehoff et al. found that organizational citizenship behaviour leads to the effectiveness of information security systems and improved compliance with security policies.
\par
Sandia National Laboratories reported that cyber security compliance is adopted based on the user's values and conduct standards. Tangible and intangible incentives play an imperative role in an individual's behaviour change for cyber security compliance.
\par
Employees' behaviour directly relates to an effective ISS compliance. The institutionalization of cyber security policies in practice encourages employees to adopt policies that make their behaviour more compliant.
\par
The above statements are enough to establish a preliminary relationship between cyber security compliance and technology adoption. A compliance-based framework for cyber security compliance is developed.
\par
Yes, Brown, Venkatesh, Yoo, Sanders \& Cerveny, 2018, Cialdini and Goldstein 2004, Griskevicius and Cialdini, 2010, Muller \& Habit Yes.
\par
The current study contributes to the literature by demonstrating a relationship between technology adoption and cyber security compliance. The study's findings can be used to help organizations strategize their security compliance framework.
\par
The authors are working on surveys for UTAUT2 constructs and some proposed new constructs that affect cyber security compliance, but have not cited the literature from a specific culture or context.
\par
In the literature review, different literature from different cultures are cited. The future work will focus on Saudi Arabia.
\par
This study has explained how technology adoption affects the employees' compliance intention and behavior towards complying with cyber security policies and measures. It also identified the seven constructs that affect the employees' compliance intention and behavior differently towards complying with cyber security policies and measures.

  abstract = {Using cloud data storage, large amounts of data can be stored by data owners in a flexible way and at low cost. Hence, there has been a major increase in online cloud service providers and their users. The privacy and security of data in the cloud computing environment is a major issue. Data privacy can be ensured by using a cryptographic access control method, so that data can only be accessed by authorized customers while keeping it inaccessible to unauthorized users. However, this type of cryptographic approach does not address the issue of trust. An integration between several trust models and cryptographic access control models has been presented in many research papers, the aim of which is to make data stored in cloud storage systems more secure. The objective of this study is to determine a solution that can suitably handle trust issues in access control models to decrease the risk as greater security to cloud storage systems, and the quality of decisions being made by data owners and cloud operators is improved. In this paper, we have presented a taxonomy for trust criteria and reputation attacks in cloud computing. Also, some of the fundamental concepts regarding trust management of services within cloud environments have been presented in this paper, along with the latest technologies. There are three layers in the model, and a series of dimensions are further determined for every layer (which are the assessment criteria), which serve as the benchmark to evaluate many research prototypes of trust models in a cloud computing environment by comparing these criteria when evaluating several trust models in a cloud computing environment. In this paper, a comparison of fifteen representative trust management research samples in cloud computing and the appropriate research domains were also carried out by employing this analytical model.},

\par
Organizations worldwide continue their effort to improve business processes and business value. The introduction of new digital methods and devices presents the challenge of realizing the new revenues and value-producing opportunities that these new digital methods and devices may provide.
\par
This study integrates prior work across multiple lines of research to explore the association between BPM capabilities and successful digitalization of organizations. It also explores the difference between ordinary and dynamic BPM capabilities.
\par
This study explores the association between BPM capabilities and the benefits of digitalization. It draws from the resource-based view of the firm and the capabilities perspective.
\par
Digitalization enables new products with new value propositions, new processes and new ways to integrate people into business processes. Eight core BPM capabilities emerge as dominant across the literature, and this study explores each of these capabilities.
\par
Process strategy is the strategic association of business processes with organizational priorities. It defines which processes will be improved and which BPM capabilities will be built.
\par
Project execution activities are typical for project management and keep process-related projects on track.
\par
Enterprise architecture activities involve the creation and management of business process and related information models.
\par
Governance refers to the process and data governance activities surrounding process management, and includes mechanisms for managing and controlling process endeavors and process changes.
\par
Culture/people enablement activities involve training, information and communication to establish a process-oriented attitude and values within the organization.
\par
Tools and technology related activities involve the use of software, hardware, social media and other digital technologies to execute business processes.
\par
The theoretical motivation for exploring BPM capabilities draws from the resource-based view and the capabilities perspective. The benefits of digitalization represent relevant elements of firm performance, and the capabilities perspective provides theoretical support for investigating the relationship among BPM capabilities and an important organizational outcome, the benefits of digitalization.
\par
This study explores associations between eight core BPM capabilities and benefits of digitalization. It finds that as BPM capabilities increase, digitalization benefits are also expected to increase.
\par
The categorization of organizational capabilities as ordinary versus dynamic within the capabilities perspective provides a framework to guide the exploration of the eight BPM capabilities. The distinction between ordinary and dynamic capabilities is also left open for further investigation.
\par
Ordinary capabilities are the ability of an organization to perform basic functional activities on an ongoing basis, and are relevant to digitalization efforts as they enable the integration of new digital technologies with existing business processes and resources to create value.
\par
Dynamic capabilities enable an organization to change by improving existing capabilities or creating new ones. These capabilities are important for a successful digitalization effort.
\par
This paper explores the impact of eight core BPM capabilities on digitalization benefits. It also provides additional insight regarding the ordinary versus dynamic distinction in the capabilities literature.
\par
Based on previous research, levels of BPM capabilities are positively associated with business value.
\par
A web-based survey was conducted by a private university in the United States, a South American university, and a USA consulting company to collect perceptions from BPM professionals regarding their organization's BPM and digitalization practices.
\par
A survey of BPM professionals within organizations provides the opportunity to capture the insight of applied research, but the data collected using a survey instrument raises the concern of common method bias. To alleviate this concern, procedural strategies were used in the design of the survey.
\par
The survey utilized various scale properties to collect information from the respondents, including proximal separation and some variation across the Likert-type scales for the items related to the dependent and independent variables.
\par
Survey responses were collected from various continents worldwide, and included business services (29\%), banking and finance (9\%), government or public administration (8\%), education (8\%), high-tech (8\%), insurance (7\%) and manufacturing (6\%). Most respondents considered themselves as mid-level management (47\%), while 35\% held senior positions.
\par
This study used scales developed by Kirchmer and Franz (2015) to examine eight core BPM capabilities in organizations. The scales were categorized as either ordinary or dynamic using a coding scheme developed by Karna et al. (2016).
\par
The benefits of digitalization include new product development, improved inter- and intraorganizational activities, and the use of digital technologies to enhance collaboration, communication and connection.
\par
Additional digitalization success aspects have been identified from an economic perspective, resulting in innovation, financial gains and reduced costs (Kotarba, 2017). These success aspects are measured from the perceived business value of the organizations' digitalization efforts.
\par
There were some differences in responses concerning BPM capabilities between respondents in terms of their location, organization revenue size, organization employee size, corporate responsibility and functional reporting area.
\par
Higher mean ranks were found for all three capabilities among respondents with a C-level responsibility, and lowest mean ranks were found for those with a staff responsibility.
\par
The respondents' perception of digitalization benefits were similar across organizations, industries and continents.
\par
To test our hypotheses, we first measured the level of agreement for eight BPM capabilities items and 20 digitalization benefits items. We then verified the framework measures using factor analyses and identified associations between BPM capabilities and digitalization benefits.
\par
Eight items were used to measure BPM capabilities. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.879, the communalities were 0.888, and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure was 0.888, indicating the items had a shared variance and a factor analysis would account for a good amount of variance.
\par
The 20 items used to measure digitalization benefits have a good internal consistency and a shared variance. A confirmatory factor analysis was administered to determine validity.
\par
The 20 items used to measure digitalization benefits were segmented into two factors: direct and indirect benefits. The direct benefits are created through a specific process improvement during the digitalization initiative, such as a cost reduction.
\par
The correlation between BPM capabilities and realized digitalization benefits was positive and significant.
\par
The results support H1 that BPM capabilities are associated with realized digitalization benefits. The results also indicate that the associations between ordinary and dynamic BPM capabilities and direct digitalization benefits are stronger than the associations between ordinary and dynamic BPM capabilities and indirect digitalization benefits.
\par
The results indicate that both ordinary and dynamic BPM capabilities have strong positive associations with direct benefits. The association between ordinary BPM capabilities and indirect digitalization benefits is the weakest.
\par
BPM capabilities that improve departmental interactions, reduce costs, improve regulatory compliance management, improve employee engagement and improve technology infrastructure have weaker correlations with direct digitalization benefits.
\par
The associations across ordinary BPM capabilities and indirect digitalization benefits were weakest. Enterprise architecture showed the most potential among ordinary BPM capabilities, being significantly associated with the indirect digitalization benefits of improved customer engagement.
\par
The associations between dynamic BPM capabilities and indirect digitalization benefits were more likely to be significant than the associations between ordinary BPM capabilities and indirect digitalization benefits. However, this association was not as consistent as the associations between ordinary and dynamic BPM capabilities and direct digitalization benefits.
\par
This study examined whether BPM capabilities were associated with benefits of digitalization. It found that BPM capabilities were associated with benefits of digitalization.
\par
BPM capabilities were categorized into ordinary and dynamic capability categories, and direct and indirect benefits of digitalization were categorized into direct and indirect benefits. However, the associations between individual BPM capabilities and specific digitalization benefits were not significant.
\par
Ordinary BPM capabilities support the day-to-day business reality, while dynamic BPM capabilities enable change and improvement. Dynamic BPM capabilities can be applied in conjunction with digitalization initiatives, thereby executing the digital transformation in one step and applying the BPM capability to augment the benefits.
\par
This study confirms positive associations between various BPM capabilities and the value delivered through digital transformation. It also suggests that BPM capabilities specifically enhanced for digital transformation may increase the positive association between BPM capabilities and digitalization benefits.
\par
The current study is limited by the use of a cross-sectional survey of knowledgeable BPM professionals, and future research could employ different or mixed methods to further refine the associations between BPM capabilities and digitalization benefits.
\par
While the data collected for this study revealed some significant differences in respondent demographics concerning their perceived level of BPM capabilities within their organization and perceived digitalization benefits, this study mainly reflects the perspective of BPM practitioners with digital transformation experience.
\par
This study validated 20 items used for digitalization benefit markers, and explored the relationship between BPM capabilities and digitalization benefits. However, future work could explore new and enhanced BPM capabilities, and expand the scope of the current study to address broader, more process-oriented models.
\par
This research examined the associations between BPM capabilities and benefits of digitalization. It found that ordinary BPM capabilities were less associated with indirect benefits of digitalization than dynamic BPM capabilities.},

  abstract = {Buyers in developed countries often spend millions of dollars per year to ensure social compliance of their suppliers, yet the social performance of suppliers in developing countries remains poor. This paper discusses supplier social compliance in terms of adoption of public (e.g., SA 8000) and private (e.g., Walmart's supplier code of conduct) social standards and elaborates on the dynamics of standards adoption decision-making. Building upon ideas of asset specificity, social exchange, and organizational citizenship behavior, this paper develops propositions to provide an overarching framework explaining the adoption of public and private social standards. The paper shows that buyers and suppliers have different perspectives towards the adoption of public and private standards. Accordingly, the extent of supplier social compliance also varies based on the type of standard adoption. Further, adopting multiple social standards, i.e., both private and public, may not bring a corresponding increase in supplier social performance. Finally, from a buyer perspective, the selection of a particular social standard may require managing trade-offs. The findings can help managers in making better social compliance decisions.},
  note = {Wordtune read
\par
Global sourcing from developing countries is on the rise, but buyers in developed countries are increasingly concerned about their suppliers' social compliance. For example, KiK, Apple, Nike, and Walmart have been criticized for failing to manage the social compliance of their suppliers in developing countries.
\par
Many suppliers pursue the implementation of social responsibility standards to manage their social compliance. These standards are either public standards (ISO 26000 and SA 8000) or private standards (codes of conduct developed by individual firms).
\par
Social standards often meet the requirements of buyers and their stakeholders, but incidents of non-compliance are widely reported. Further research is needed to better predict buyer and supplier behaviors regarding social standards adoption.
\par
Previous research has explored the role of different forms of buyer-supplier governance mechanisms on supplier environmental or social performance. This paper explores the role of different formats of social standards on supplier performance.
\par
This paper presents five propositions regarding buyer and supplier perspectives on social standards adoption, and explains the factors that can influence standard adoption decisions, such as buyer transaction cost, trade-offs, perceptions of risk propensity, the longevity of the business, and the value of transactions.
\par
The development of the conceptual framework and propositions was accomplished through a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature. The search produced 400 papers, and was narrowed down to papers that discussed supplier social compliance, any social compliance format, and buyer and/or supplier perspectives in social compliance.
\par
The review process was based on a deductive-inductive approach, and the key concepts were defined a priori. The deductive approach focused on how social standards and code of conducts unfolded and played out in buyer-supplier transactions, and the inductive approach kept open to the emergence of new ideas.
\par
To address social compliance requirements, buyers and suppliers seek means for systematic implementation of social compliance in suppliers' facilities through a combination of organizational policies, rules, and procedures. One structured approach to supplier social compliance is through the implementation of public and private standards.
\par
Public standards are developed by industrial associations for a particular industry, and national standards exist for safe work environments in the garment and textile industry in Bangladesh.
\par
Private standards are developed by individual firms or industries for their own suppliers. They may build upon public standards, but mainly reflect the vision, core values, mindset of company managers, and strategic priorities of the buyer.
\par
Many broader initiatives exist to facilitate organizations in demonstrating environmentally responsible behaviors. These initiatives focus primarily on environmental sustainability, rather than social issues, but can be used to supplement social compliance standards.
\par
The review of the literature shows that there are three distinct streams of research on supplier social compliance.
\par
Studies on buyer-supplier relationships, buyer-supplier governance mechanisms, the effectiveness of different buyer-supplier governance approaches, and preventing opportunism in the relationship are inconsistent. Further investigation is warranted into the dynamics of buyer-supplier relationships and how buyers and suppliers make decisions regarding social compliance standards.
\par
The second stream discusses the implementation of social standards, including the drivers of social compliance, benefits of social standards adoption, and challenges in implementation. It also discusses the benefits of social standards adoption, such as improved work conditions, communication, and work relationships.
\par
Studies that discuss social compliance standards themselves and literature reviews focus on the contents of the standards, their development, and diffusion in a particular industry. These studies rarely explore the relationship between standards adoption and performance.
\par
The current literature focuses on environmental sustainability more than social sustainability, and discusses environmental standards more than social standards. The adoption of social standards is not discussed, and the dynamics underlying the adoption of public and private social standards remain a mystery.
\par
The perspectives of suppliers and buyers in standard adoption are often overlooked in the existing literature. Hence, there is a need to study how buyers and suppliers make decisions regarding social standards adoption.
\par
The current literature highlights supplier opportunism as a key problem in buyer-supplier relationships. However, this paper posits that understanding the motivation and concerns of suppliers in adopting a particular format of social standard can help prevent opportunism.
\par
The adoption of social standards requires several trade-offs for both buyers and suppliers, including business and economic considerations, the cost of standard implementation, and the market recognition of the standard. The extant literature has largely ignored the trade-off perspective in social standards adoption.
\par
Institutional theory explains how normative, coercive, and mimetic pressures lead to the diffusion of an innovation or management practice, leading to institutional isomorphism.
\par
Institutional theory discusses the diffusion of management practices at the industry level, but does not address the intricacies of social standards adoption at the buyer-supplier level.
\par
The transactional approach reflects a market approach in business transactions, while the relational approach reflects a relationship approach in which the buyer makes ex-ante investments in the supplier to improve their capacity, product quality, and generate supplier commitment.
\par
The buyer-supplier governance framework implies that in the transactional approach, a buyer chooses a supplier based on the supplier's social compliance capacity, but in the relational approach, the buyer makes ex-ante investments in the supplier's capacity building.
\par
A spiral relationship occurs when individuals are unable to change their behavior despite changing conditions, and is characterized by poor or good relationships with the potential for improvement.
\par
Relationship strength theory provides a valuable lens to understand the dynamics underlying social standards adoption. It suggests that stronger buyer-supplier relationships can make the interests of both partners aligned, leading to social standards adoption decisions that accommodate the interests of both partners.
\par
The competing values model (CMV) is an internal-values oriented tool to predict a supplier's behavior in adopting social standards. The values of the supplier may give the buyer hints in predicting supplier dispositions, and the buyer may devise appropriate incentives to stimulate supplier social compliance.
\par
High asset specificity investments benefit only one partnership, while low asset specificity investments benefit multiple partnerships. A supplier will be more motivated to implement a public standard than a private standard.
\par
The asset specificity view helps to understand why buyers ask for private standards, and why suppliers seek market recognition and cost-benefit aspects.
\par
Social exchange theory argues that when one party does an act of goodwill for another, the original action is potentially reciprocated. This creates opportunities for generating high-quality relationships.
\par
When a firm implements social compliance standards, it improves employee working conditions and motivates employees to respond by being more committed to their work and making extra efforts to reciprocate the firm's action.
\par
Agency theory views a firm as a nexus of contracts among self-interested individuals rather than as a unified, profit-maximizing entity. A principal employs agents to run an organization on their behalf, and the agents may act with guile and pursue their own interests.
\par
Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) is defined as voluntary behavior that benefits the organization. It can take place at the self, group, organization, or society level.
\par
Social standards and organizational citizenship behavior share some common space in organizational management models. Both promote prosocial behavior, cooperation, and responsibility to the organization, groups, and people.
\par
The theories reviewed above shed light on the dynamics of social standards adoption. Among other things, market recognition of the standard, implementation and maintenance costs, internal support from employees, and economic incentives from the buyer influence standard adoption.
\par
The buyer's perspective on social compliance requirements is the key consideration in a standard's specification. The buyer may choose a general standard or a tailor-made standard, and may have to invest in the supplier to achieve the desired level of social compliance.
\par
A buyer will prefer to adopt a public standard over a private standard, because public standards enjoy broader international recognition, and because private standards require the buyer to train suppliers in implementation, administration, and auditing, thus, increasing the overall cost to the buyer.
\par
The framework developed in this paper provides a clearer picture of the perspectives of the buyer and supplier in standards adoption. Understanding these perspectives is the first step towards genuine supplier social compliance.
\par
A supplier will adopt a public standard if it is valuable to many buyers, thus creating more business opportunities.
\par
Public standards are widely known and accepted, and are easily implemented. Auditing and certification procedures are well understood, making them standards of preferred choice.
\par
A private social standard is more valuable to one particular buyer and requires special knowledge and competencies for implementation. The buyer may need to provide support for implementation and auditing, and may also have trust issues with the supplier.
\par
Public standards are more likely to be implemented by suppliers for the sake of legitimacy in the eyes of stakeholders, rather than social performance improvement, because public standards require developing structures and processes, presenting sanction mechanisms, requiring evidence of performance, and exhibit high costs of adoption.
\par
When a buyer demands that a supplier adopt private standards, the transaction cost increases because the buyer needs to engage with the supplier in implementation and post-implementation activities, incurring a cost to the buyer.
\par
The buyer's transaction cost can be minimized by requiring public standards from suppliers. Public standards are audited against the standard's clauses, and suppliers enjoy greater clarity in implementing the standard.
\par
A buyer can choose between public standards and private standards to address the values outlined in its corporate culture, mission, vision, business philosophy, or strategic plan. Private standards enable the buyer to emphasize certain values in supplier social compliance.
\par
Public social standards may be perceived differently by employees, but they will benefit the organization through prosocial and civil behaviors, such as saving organizational resources, showing more diligence at work, friendly behaviors towards customers, helping newly hired employees, and increased cohesion within groups.
\par
Private standards are implemented to meet the needs of a particular buyer, and are perceived as an imposed requirement for business continuity. They are not perceived as home-grown management systems for employee welfare, and are disconnected from organizational practices, and do not generate employee commitment.
\par
A supplier may implement both public and private standards in order to increase business opportunities and increase its competitive advantage. The buyer may assume a lower degree of risk if the supplier implements both types of standards.
\par
The actual effect of implementing both types of standards may be just the opposite, because they may have several common elements and may make the system bulky, complex, and bureaucratic, which may disadvantage the supplier.
\par
Supplier social compliance is one of the most pressing agenda items in international buyer-supplier relationships. However, many prominent buyers have taken steps to improve the social performance of their suppliers.
\par
This paper makes a distinction between public and private standards, which is missing in previous studies. This study is the first to discuss public and private standards separately.
\par
This paper opens the black box of the social standards adoption decision-making process by discussing the perspectives of both the buyer and supplier. It shows that different perceptions regarding the value of public and private standards are inevitable.
\par
This paper shows how employees view standards adoption positively and how this view affects their behavior. It also shows that implementing multiple standards may be counterproductive because it makes the system bulky and bureaucratic.
\par
International buyers may prefer private standards, while suppliers may prefer public standards. Understanding and reconciling these differences is the cornerstone of effective supplier social compliance.
\par
Traditionally, social compliance decisions in buyer-supplier relationships have been primarily one-sided. However, with increasing power asymmetry, buyers should take suppliers' input into social compliance decisions and consider the transaction costs of using private standards.
\par
When employees buy-in to standards implementation, they will respond with behaviors that can improve firm performance.
\par
The findings show that buyers and suppliers view social compliance standards differently. For buyers, the transaction cost, the scope of social compliance requirements, and diligent social compliance are important.
\par
This paper advances the discussion on managing supplier social sustainability by providing insights into the perspectives of buyers and suppliers.
\par
This paper has limitations that provide opportunities for future research. For instance, longitudinal studies can be used to explore how suppliers respond to buyer demand for a type of standard they do not prefer, and how buyers make trade-offs between customization of private standards and increased transaction cost.
\par
This study does not discuss how buyer-supplier relationships influence standards adoption. Future research should explore the value of integrating multiple standards, and whether integrating two different social standards brings any additional value.},

This paper builds on a systematic review of the literature to discuss the antecedents of decoupling. The paper has three main contributions. First, it identifies the antecedents of SES decoupling; second, it develops a taxonomy of the antecedents, and finally, it develops a model comprising a set of propositions explaining how the identified antecedents bring about decoupling.

  abstract = {Protecting employee whistle-blowers is important, as this is a significant source of uncovering wrongdoing, both for public, and private organizations. How whistle-blowers make decisions is complex, and potential whistle-blowers may not have complete information on the strategies that are chosen by their organizations in response. Hence, whistle-blowers must undertake decisions in uncertain conditions. It is in dealing with this uncertainty where behavioural economics is informative. This paper reviews the behavioural economics perspective on compliance with rules (broadly) and with whistle-blowing and antitrust compliance (more specifically) culminating in a series of recommendations for organizations seeking to improve employee compliance and detection of potential infringements of the law. I focus on four main points: First, is the importance of voluntary compliance (as opposed to enforced compliance). This is important because it carries a broader set of actions than enforced compliance (which typically pertains to behaviour that is observable). Highlighting non-pecuniary rewards, such as benefits to society, reputational gains, and career impacts, are critical. Second, is the importance of perceptions and beliefs. Focusing on whistle-blower protections and correcting beliefs regarding the risks (and potential losses) associated with reporting are critical. Third, beliefs are typically the result of social norms: shared expectations of behaviour. Collecting information on norms and correcting misperceptions is an important way to increase compliance. Fourth, selecting the right workers: Selecting workers with strong preferences for compliance (those that are more pro-socially motivated) allows for increases in compliance without the need of strong monetary incentives.},

\par
Protecting employee whistle-blowers is important, as it allows them to uncover wrongdoing. Behavioral economics can help organizations increase employee compliance by focusing on non-pecuniary rewards, correcting misperceptions, collecting information on social norms, and selecting the right workers.
\par
Many countries have introduced whistle-blower protections since the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, including anti-retaliation provisions and whistle-blower award programs.
\par
Call et al. report that the involvement of employee whistle-blowers in enforcement actions yields higher monetary penalties and longer prison sentences for targeted firms/employees, and that these effects persist even with whistle-blowers that started proceedings (i.e. tipsters).
\par
Whistle-blowers make decisions based on three options: to remain silent, to speak up, or to exit the firm. The decision to speak up is followed by a decision on whether to raise concerns internally or to approach an external organization.
\par
This chapter reviews the behavioural economics perspective on compliance with rules and whistle-blowing. It focuses on health and taxation and discusses the core decision problem of motivating employees to report wrongdoing.
\par
The chapter focuses on four main points: voluntary compliance, pecuniary rewards, benefits to society, reputational gains, and career impacts. Voluntary compliance is important because it carries a broader set of actions than enforced compliance.
\par
This chapter highlights how beliefs differ significantly from reality, and how individuals are loss averse, responding more strongly to losses than to gains. Hence, correcting beliefs about potential losses is important.
\par
When faced with an uncertain decision, individuals act on their beliefs about likely outcomes. These beliefs may be inaccurate or misperceived, resulting in less than optimal behaviour.
\par
The fourth and final point is that selection is a critical, yet understudied, part of the compliance story. Selection can be done by attracting motivated workers and using incentives that are a waste of resources for less motivated workers.
\par
The literature on behavioural compliance provides us with a few general lessons. Focusing on mitigating losses, emphasizing the non-pecuniary benefits of whistle-blowing, and correcting misperceptions about social norms can all improve incentives for whistle-blowing.
\par
The rest of the paper discusses voluntary compliance, individual perceptions, social norms, and worker selection.
\par
Employees are a significant proportion of whistle-blowers of corporate fraud, but they often come out worse than the wrong-doers. Hence, whistle-blower protections are even more important than reward programs, due to the well-known behavioural feature of loss aversion.
\par
Tax compliance is a problem that shares many features with the whistle-blowing problem, in that there are strong incentives to evade taxes, yet many individuals do not do so. The rewards of compliance are beneficial for society, and both individual and societal benefits are hard to observe.
\par
The Dodd-Frank Act (2010) was passed to correct for individual benefits to compliance. The implementation of Dodd-Frank increased internal regulations and controls within firms in order to find and correct instances of fraud and misreporting within the organization itself.
\par
Financial incentives are difficult to implement and may have unintended consequences, for example, financial incentives tend to apply to behaviour that is easily observable and measurable, such as fraud, and rewards are paid out after successful action resulting in relatively large fines.
\par
Financial incentives can often backfire and reduce compliance, particularly if the fines are perceived as unfair. For example, in a laboratory study, when subjects are faced with a situation involving trusting other subjects, when fines are possible, subjects respond by increasing their cooperation, but when fines are possible, subjects respond by decreasing their cooperation.
\par
The literature on tax compliance makes a distinction between enforced and voluntary compliance, and states that enforced compliance (deterrence) emphasizes the role of sanctions and creates an adversarial relationship with tax authorities, while voluntary compliance (non-deterrence) emphasizes norms of compliance and benefits to compliance.
\par
Increasing voluntary compliance is important, but the core question remains as to how to accomplish this. Trust in the authorities, clear, consistent communication, and the perception of risk all play a factor in increasing voluntary compliance.
\par
The findings from the literature point to the importance of voluntary compliance, and that there is considerable scope to improve compliance outside of (costly) enforcement mechanisms. Organizations can engage in information campaigns focusing on the benefits of compliance.
\par
The rewards from compliance are typically opaque and uncertain from the perspective of employees, but bring large rewards to society as a whole. Correcting perceptions becomes very important in situations such as employee whistle-blowing.
\par
In the whistle-blowing context, the framing of the problem as a gain or a loss matters for the decision. Subjects react more strongly to losses than to gains, and legislation focusing on individual rewards is effective in driving behaviour, but mitigation of individual losses is more important.
\par
In the literature on tax compliance, individuals overestimate audit probabilities and fine intensity. If the belief that one will incur losses is similarly overstated in the whistle-blowing context, one would expect an increase in whistle-blowing behaviour.
\par
Hallsworth reviews the empirical literature on tax compliance and finds that deterrence approaches increasing compliance are effective. For example, giving taxpayers their future audit probabilities can increase compliance, and a message emphasizing punishments can increase compliance.
\par
The literature on tax compliance and deterrence informs our insights into whistle-blowing, but this literature heavily emphasizes punishments, and the probability of punishment, rather than rewards. There is some evidence that non-deterrence interventions (emphasizing benefits of compliance, social norms, fairness concerns, etc) increase compliance.
\par
Two factors are at play in the whistle-blowing context: loss mitigation (i.e. whistle-blower protections) and reducing the uncertainty associated with reward or punishment outcomes (i.e. reducing the probability of incurring sanctions).
\par
Dyck, Morse, and Zingales note that the largest proportion of fraud detection cases involve employees, but that whistle-blowing decisions involve a large degree of uncertainty. In situations of uncertainty, beliefs and norms are critical.
\par
Social norms are important in explaining evolutionary cooperation, increasing savings, changing behaviour within households, deterring crime, and increasing recycling. Norms carry social rewards, and hence can hinder or facilitate action.
\par
Norms can be misperceived, and accurate information is important in changing behaviour. For example, in Saudi Arabia, men believed that other men did not support their spouses working outside the home, but in fact they supported their spouses working outside the home.
\par
People react to others' choices, even when others' choices are changing over time. Correcting social norms can be an effective strategy for promoting compliance, but it is important to first measure the baseline level of information that the relevant actors carry.
\par
The role of selection in compliance is largely unaddressed in the literature on public sector management. It is now clear that many employees are motivated by the outcomes of their actions rather than by monetary incentives.
\par
In the tax compliance literature, messaging can have positive effects on average, but the effect itself can depend on other contextual factors. For example, the effects of increased threat of audit are concentrated among low and middle income taxpayers, while negative effects are found among high income taxpayers.
\par
The literature on prosocial motivation and effort further highlights the importance of baseline motives and incentives. In particular, prosocially motivated agents provide higher effort than individuals choosing to work in other sectors, and high powered incentives are effective for workers with little intrinsic motivation but inefficient for motivated agents.
\par
Mechanisms exist to attract different types of workers. For example, those that are likely to cheat in an experiment are also likely to join the public sector, and are also more likely to shirk.
\par
Studies show that individual preferences differ in terms of truth-telling, and that those with high moral costs are likely to act ethically. Managers should emphasize the importance of early fraud detection and attract and retain motivated workers into monitoring and audit positions.
\par
This chapter discussed the behavioural economics of whistle-blowing/compliance and specifically focused on the individual employee, shown to be one of the major sources for uncovering business wrongdoing. The chapter highlighted the importance of communicating societal benefits from whistle-blowing and providing information on the likelihood of incurring losses.
\par
These findings have important implications for antitrust compliance, as they show that whistle-blower incentives can have uncertain effects and that organisations should focus on creating a culture of compliance.},

We conducted a repeated measures factorial design survey using a survey panel of full-time working adults provided by Qualtrics. Participants received a SETA communication with a combination of one to three persuasion statements (informational influence, normative influence statement, and/or an antineutralization), followed by a scenario description that asked for their intentions to comply with the security policy. We found that both informational (weakly) and antineutralization communication (strongly) decreased violation intentions, but that normative communication had no effect. In scenarios where neutralizations were explicitly suggested to participants, antineutralization communication was the only approach that worked. Our findings suggest that we need more research on SETA techniques that include antineutralization communication to understand how it influences behavior beyond informational and normative communication.},

\par
We investigated three theory-based communication approaches to increase compliance behavior in security education, training, and awareness programs: informational communication, normative communication, and antineutralization communication. We found that antineutralization communication was the only approach that worked.
\par
Information security is a strategic issue for organizations that share knowledge and conduct online transactions. Through organizational sanctions and security education, training, and awareness programs, security professionals actively battle security incidents.
\par
Modern organizations develop or purchase security awareness training programs to reinforce acceptable use guidelines and emphasize the potential consequences of information security policy violations. However, traditional SETA approaches are often ineffective in preventing violations, so it is imperative to explore other approaches to designing SETA programs.
\par
Short periodic communications may be used to augment SETA education and training programs, and may be critical to ensure greater security policy compliance. For example, Providence Health and Services has replaced office notes with ones that say "protect confidential information" and other reminders.
\par
Despite the widespread use of security awareness training programs, employees are often noncompliant with security policies. Many vulnerabilities arise from nonmalicious security policy violations, such as sharing passwords, which may be due to human error, negligence, or poor training.
\par
When faced with a situation to comply or not comply with a security policy, employees assess potential consequences and often minimize perceptions of negative consequences by rationalizing that their actions are necessary to accomplish some higher objective.
\par
Informational and normative influence have been extensively researched in information systems, including topics such as system resistance, technology use and usefulness, viral marketing, and computer-mediated communication. However, few studies have proposed and tested practical interventions that leverage these to influence compliance behavior.
\par
Information influence and normative influence focus on the situation and the desired behavior, but antineutralization communication directly targets the neutralization techniques that employees use to talk themselves out of complying with information security policies. Information influence and normative influence are ineffective at increasing compliance with information security policies.
\par
This paper presents the theoretical background, the factorial survey design, and the statistical analysis used to test the hypotheses.
\par
When faced with a situation requiring them to choose to comply with or violate a security policy, employees consider the information about the situation, the norms of others, and the potential reasons to rationalize away the need to comply. SETA programs that use information influence, normative influence, and antineutralization approaches may increase security policy compliance.
\par
Our study uses three approaches to reduce security violation intentions: informational influence, normative influence, and neutralization. The sections below describe each aspect in more detail.
\par
Neutralization is defined as the use of rationalizations when violating a policy. There are 17 different neutralization techniques, including denial of injury and defense of necessity.
\par
Research shows that neutralization techniques are more powerful than sanctions in predicting information security violations.
\par
When an individual considers violating a rule, cognitive dissonance exists between perceptions that the action is justifiable and knowledge that the action is prohibited. Neutralization techniques reduce or eliminate the perceived negative consequences of violating the rule, which makes the behavior less risky.
\par
This study examined the effects of three different types of influence communication on intentions to violate information security policies. It found that informational, normative, and antineutralization statements were all effective at reducing violation intentions.
\par
Informational influence occurs when individuals deeply consider new information about alternatives to a behavior and incorporate the information into their existing mental schemas. Information that highlights the costs of a behavior may influence individuals to abstain from that behavior.
\par
We focus on the direct costs of security violation behavior itself, not on indirect costs, such as sanctions designed to deter such behavior. SETA communications should explain the consequences of engaging in a proscribed behavior or failing to engage in a required behavior.
\par
When employees consider a policy-violating action, they assess information supporting the policy and use moral reasoning to come to a decision. Studies suggest that providing appropriate supporting information about the reasons for security policies may positively influence employee security behaviors.
\par
In an action research study of a Finnish company, providing information about the consequences of security policy violations influences violation behavior. After receiving a three-session multihour training program on the policy of encrypting emails containing confidential information, five employees reported that they were more motivated to comply.
\par
The Puhakainen and Siponen (2010) study did not analyze whether the informational persuasion technique would be strong enough in situations where employees might commonly neutralize their behavior, making it unclear whether the results from Puhakainen and Siponen (2010) would generalize to our setting.
\par
Normative influence occurs when individuals use the beliefs and actions of others as a guide for their own behavior, and comply due to the desire for social support or to avoid social sigma.
\par
Normative influence has been theorized to influence decisions about whether or not to violate security policy. Studies suggest that providing normative information before a decision would influence behavior.
\par
We argue that providing normative information will influence security violation decisions, because it helps employees resolve the cognitive dissonance felt in situations where there are benefits for both compliance and noncompliance.
\par
Information influence and normative influence drive compliance decisions. Neutralization involves rationalizing away the information influence and normative influence factors that support compliance so they become less important than the factors favoring noncompliance.
\par
In this section, we focus on a third type of security communication, antineutralization communication, that is separate from the situation.
\par
Neutralization behaviors are often driven by cognitive dissonance. When employees perceive extra costs from complying with a policy, they may be tempted to violate the policies.
\par
Security-related behavior may be influenced by heuristics or biases, such as anchoring, optimism bias, loss aversion, etc. Training against neutralizations may help users become more cognizant of thought processes that may have negative consequences.
\par
Because employee rationalizations eliminate cognitive dissonance, antineutralization communication can be used to discourage these justifications. Antineutralization communication argues that there are no situational ethics and that employees should ignore rationalizations and comply with security policy.
\par
One previous study found that neutralization focused communication reduced violation intentions, but it is still unclear whether antineutralization communication alone can cognitively influence individuals' security intentions in a different manner than informational and normative communication.
\par
We used a scenario-based factorial survey method design to test our hypotheses, and asked participants to answer survey questions based on their perceptions of each scenario. Security and business ethics researchers often use scenario-based methods to measure deviant behavior, but the factorial survey methodology strengthens the value of the results by incorporating a full factorial of all realistic combinations of all levels and dimensions of each variable being investigated.
\par
We convened an expert review panel to ensure realism, content validity, and face validity of the scenario-based survey, and then conducted a small pilot study to confirm discriminant and convergent validity.
\par
Participants were recruited through Qualtrics, a survey and Internet panel provider firm. They completed a random set of two scenarios, and the final data sample consisted of 200 participants.
\par
Participants read two scenarios that detailed violations of information security policies in familiar situations, and responded to various items, including the violation intention of the participant if they experienced similar circumstances.
\par
We conducted a 2 x 2 factorial design to test our hypotheses that neutralization techniques can reduce password sharing. We used the "denial of injury" and "defense of necessity" neutralization techniques in our scenario treatments.
\par
We asked respondents to rate the likelihood that they would violate a security policy using a five-point Likert-type scale.
\par
After answering filter questions, participants viewed a scenario, immediately followed by a set of manipulation check questions, and responded to four dependent variable items and two additional items. They were also asked to indicate whether they could imagine a similar scenario taking place at their company.
\par
We used the scenario technique rather than direct questions, randomized the set of scenarios that each participant would receive, used the response set question, and used manipulation check questions to ensure that participants would not simply give patterned, automatic responses.
\par
The realism of the scenarios was ensured by two expert panels, and the realism question was included in the survey to control for the effects of scenario realism.
\par
We collected data from 200 individuals, who answered two scenarios each. We repeated the analysis on data that was filtered out.
\par
Ordinary least squares regression (OLS) is a preferred technique for the factorial survey design, but the dependent variable in behavioral security research often displays a skewed distribution.
\par
The Kolgomorov-Smirnov and Shapiro Wilk tests indicated that our data are not normally distributed, and that OLS regression violates the assumption of independence of errors. We used the generalized linear mixed models function in SPSS to analyze the data.
\par
The full results of the data analysis are listed in Table 2, as well as a follow-up analysis with selected scenarios.
\par
Participants who viewed scenarios with neutralization techniques were more likely to form information security policy violation intentions, while participants who received informational statements were less likely to form information security policy violation intentions.
\par
We tested the effects of persuasion techniques on violation intentions in situations where participants were highly prone to neutralize their behavior. Antineutralization statements had a significant impact on behavior, but information influence and normative influence statements did not.
\par
Participants' information security policy violation intentions decreased as they viewed additional influential communication in the scenarios, and viewing the security policy statement twice had no effect on the participants' information security policy violation intentions.
\par
We ran a separate model with only scenarios first seen by a participant, and found that the explicit use of neutralization techniques in the scenario was no longer statistically significantly related to intentions to violate the policy.
\par
We found that the perceived realism of the scenarios did not affect how participants rated their intentions to violate the information security policy, and that the antineutralization statement influenced participants to be less likely to violate the policy.
\par
We found no significant results for interaction effects between neutralization types and the hypothesized effects of informational, normative, and antineutralization statements. This suggests that antineutralization statements are influential against multiple types of neutralization techniques.
\par
This study shows that short informational statements about the reasons why information security policies exist, and statements specifically designed to counter neutralization techniques, can increase compliance with information security policies, particularly in situations where individuals consider benefits of noncompliance. However, short normative statements do not reduce intentions to violate information security policy.
\par
Reading normative information did not increase compliance behavior. Normative influence is stronger when individuals are closer in "proximity" to others whose norms they are considering, and reading normative information in SETA communication from the organization is not as powerful as normative influence experienced directly from peers.
\par
We studied short, focused SETA communications, and found that they had a weaker effect than active learning techniques, which took hours to implement.
\par
We measured compliance intentions directly after delivering information security communication to the participants. However, a longer period of time may pass between the security communication and the decision to violate a policy, and future research could include distractor tasks.
\par
The limitations of the study include testing the theories only within one specific security policy violation behavior, namely password sharing, and with only two potential neutralization strategies. Additionally, the study only specifically examined two types of neutralization techniques, and future research should examine this technique against other neutralization types.
\par
Barlow et al. (2013) examined the effect of informational, normative, and antineutralization statements on compliance behavior and found no effect.
\par
The scenarios did not include statements about the severity of the sanctions or the certainty of the penalties, but future studies could include these statements.
\par
We studied nonmalicious security policy violations, which may have different motivations than malicious violations. Future research should examine whether antineutralization communication has any effect on malicious violations.
\par
We used a cross-sectional design with random assignment to measure the effects of security communication.
\par
This study shows that short reinforcing SETA communications containing informational, normative, and antineutralization statements are effective in diminishing information security policy violations. The study also shows that the effectiveness of antineutralization statements can be strengthened by increasing their length and persuasiveness.
\par
We found mixed effects from a simple one-sentence informational statement designed to explain the consequences of violating policies. More information would have a greater impact.
\par
Informational statements and antineutralization statements act independently of each other, indicating that they have different "receptors" and can be used in conjunction with each other.
\par
In scenarios where rationalization would be easy, normative statements about what the majority of employees would do were not powerful enough to influence violation intentions. We need more research to better understand why some factors shown to influence intentions can be used to alter them whereas others cannot.
\par
This study found that people felt more motivated to use neutralizations when they perceived some direct benefit from doing so.
\par
This research shows that incorporating cognitive concepts such as informational and normative communication into information security research has an influence on policy violations. This provides rich insights into the ways we can influence information systems security compliance.
\par
This study recommends that organizations include specific, strong informational statements in their security communication, and that they directly communicate that the usage of neutralization techniques is unacceptable.
\par
This study investigated how persuasion techniques can be used to decrease employee intentions to violate information security policies. Informational statements and antineutralization statements were found to be particularly helpful.
\par
We contracted with Qualtrics to acquire survey responses from 200 participants who passed all filter, response set, and manipulation check questions in our design. Of these 200 participants, 303 did not correctly answer all manipulation check questions, leaving 241 participants with valid responses to at least one scenario.
\par
We obtained 200 valid survey completions from Qualtrics, and repeated our analysis on three additional data sets that included excluded participants. The third data set consisted of all data where participants passed the initial filter questions, regardless of whether they answered response set and/or manipulation check questions correctly.
\par
The results of analyzing these additional data sets were largely similar to the results of the main analysis, except that realism was significant in these data sets and information influence statements were only statistically significant in data set "B".
\par
In these additional data sets, we also controlled for the effects of completing the survey, passing manipulation checks, and passing the response set questions on stating intentions to violate policy.
\par
When testing only the first scenarios, the explicit use of neutralization techniques was no longer statistically significantly related to intentions to violate the policy. Informational statements also had a weak effect.
\par
We found no significant interaction effects between neutralization types and the hypothesized effects of informational, normative, and antineutralization statements.

\par
This research presents a practical use case for the implementation of a Process Mining application at the risk management department of financial institutions. The value of using a technical application is discussed.
\par
Since the global financial and economic crisis of 2007-2008, banks and other financial institutions have been challenged by the exponential increase of regulatory requirements. This is because governments throughout the world want to ensure stability and reliability of the financial sector.
\par
Financial institutions need to develop and implement new technological solutions to deal with the growing complexity of regulatory requirements. These solutions should be able to deal with high amounts of data, gathered from various sources, while offering an increasing depth of analysis.
\par
In the post financial crisis period, banking supervision authorities have focused significantly more on the management of business processes. A system-based compliance checking approach and strategy is recommended to trace the sources of violations in a precise and reliable manner.
\par
Compliance management using process mining requires the analysis of two different perspectives: the theoretical description of business processes in the work instructions of an institution and the real-life execution of business processes within an organization. Process mining applications can help an institution to discover potential discrepancies.
\par
Process Mining is a research discipline that aims to discover, monitor and improve real processes by extracting knowledge from event logs.
\par
Process Mining techniques can be applied to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of compliance management activities in the risk management environment of a financial institution in Germany.
\par
In this section, selected Process Mining applications from different technology companies are presented. One specific application is then selected for the practical strategy development, and this application is already in use at several economic companies to analyse real-life business processes.
\par
One specific application is selected for the development of an implementation strategy, which has to fulfil five criteria. This application has to be capable of analysing large data sets.
\par
A process mining implementation strategy can be developed using the applications myInvenio Process Analyst, Disco and QPR ProcessAnalyzer that can be installed locally. The application Disco can be used to create smart flow diagrams of business processes in an organization using log data.
\par
Process Mining offers a technical solution for organizations that is capable of making the execution of real-life business processes measurable and enables a real-time compliance analysis. This research focuses on the implementation of a Process Mining application in the risk management environment of financial institutions.
\par
The implementation strategy for the Process Mining application needs to consider the compliance of business processes throughout the entire business process management lifecycle. This includes the process discovery and analysis phases, the process design phase, and the process execution phase.
\par
The third step of the strategy development is planning of the Process Mining implementation. To do so, six basic questions need to be answered, and criteria for the selection of a risk management business process that is analysed by a Process Mining application are defined.
\par
Process mining can be used to evaluate critical business processes in the risk management environment. These processes must be executed more than 100 times a year and must be available and exportable.
\par
The IBM Credit Bank in Germany selected the business process "Annual Account Review" to be investigated with the Process Mining application Disco. The AAR process is used to regularly control the accounts of the credit customers of financial institutions.
\par
The AAR process involves two different participants, the Account Manager and the Risk Manager. The Risk Manager controls the review activities of the Account Manager.
\par
To upload data into the Process Mining tool, you need to gather and extract data from log files. Then you upload the data into the Process Mining application, which generates a process model.
\par
To create a process model with Disco, the log files need to contain information regarding the execution of the analysed business process. This information includes a unique identifier for each individual process, information about the event that represents an activity in a process, and date and time information.
\par
In this research, the data regarding the process participants are anonymized and the timestamps are modified based on the information provided by the credit institution. This allows the analysis to give an overview how the implementation of a Process Mining strategy can help financial institutions to enhance their compliance management procedures.
\par
The CSV file containing the required information about the AAR process needs to be uploaded into the Disco application.
\par
The information required by the Disco application is presented through different images. The import of the data is performed by clicking on the "start import" button, and a model of the business process is created automatically.
\par
Process Mining applications such as Disco offer several evaluation models and statistics that can be used to monitor whether a selected process chain is executed in a compliant manner.
\par
AAR process execution model compares real-life process execution to theoretical process description and shows that one of the illustrated process chains is not compliant with the description in the work instructions. This case is analysed in more detail in the subsequent execution step.
\par
The evaluation of this particular process execution shows that the process chain ended in a non-compliant manner because the client did not submit the requested documents to the Account Manager. However, because all other cases were carried out in accordance with the internal and external guidelines, the deviation is acceptable.
\par
Disco offers an evaluation table of the process durations, which shows that the longest execution time is presented for case ID 163, with a duration of 34 days and 10 h.
\par
The institution defines that the AAR process is to be executed within one month after the AAR due date. Three cases are non-compliant and the Compliance Manager or Auditor can investigate the reasons for the deviations.
\par
Disco offers a process model that visualizes the average durations of each activity. The average duration of 55.8 h is acceptable because the clients that had to submit further documents needed some time to respond to the request of the Account Manager.
\par
Process Mining applications can be used to discover whether a selected business process in the risk management environment of financial institutions is executed in compliance with internal and external regulations. The evaluation of the process data shows that the application can facilitate and enhance compliance management activities.},

\par
We explore different denominations for regulatory technology and search for relevant literature portals. We select 55 articles that address the application of information technology in regulatory affairs with an emphasis on the financial sector.
\par
New technologies and technology companies have disrupted the financial industry. RegTech, or regulatory technology, is a new and vital dimension of FinTech, which can be regarded as a new and vital dimension of FinTech.
\par
RegTech is a comparatively young field of research. It is used to describe both technological solutions that aim to assist FIs in dealing with regulatory issues and companies or organizations that have specialized in this business area.
\par
In order to examine the research area more closely, we first search for the unambiguous terms 'regtech' and 'regulatory technology' in the topic field of the Web of Science database. We then search for 'regulatory' and 'compliance' in combination with mentioning information technologies through proximity algorithms.
\par
We investigate English-written scientific literature that covers the thematic field of RegTech. We consider the following literature research online portals to retrieve relevant RegTech publications: Emerald Insight, IDEAS RePEc database, Oxford Academic Journals, Sage Journals, Science Direct, Social Science Research Network, Springer Link, Web of Science. We used two search queries in each of the presented literature research online portals to identify and select relevant journal articles. We double-checked the results of these searches with additional, individual search commands to find further highly related articles.
\par
We investigated 55 relevant journal articles in the investigated literature research online portals, of which the Social Science Research Network revealed the highest number of hits (19 articles), followed by Web of Science (10 articles).
\par
The next step of our research is to analyse the retrieved journal articles concerning the main topics and, specifically, the ITs that they cover. We present an overview of the relative frequency of the topics covered in the investigated journals.
\par
The bar chart in Figure 1 shows that 'risk management', 'compliance management', and 'regulatory reporting' are the most relevant topics in the literature. Several articles address these topics, such as Arner, Barberis, and Buckley (2016) and Butler, 2017; Larsen \& Gilani, 2017; Treleaven \& Batrinca, 2017; van Liebergen, 2017; Weber, 2019.
\par
The most frequent topics in the articles are financial regulation (16.7\%), transaction monitoring (12.8\%), identity management and control (9.0\%), distributed ledger technologies (16 articles), artificial intelligence (seven articles), cybersecurity (five articles), data mining (5 articles), regulatory sandbox (5 articles), machine learning (4 articles), and cloud computing (1 article).
\par
The evaluation of the chart in Figure 2 reveals that 'distributed ledger technology' is a prominent topic in 37.2\% of the articles investigated. 'Artificial intelligence' is in second position and covered in 16.3\% of the articles, while 'cybersecurity', 'data mining', and 'regulatory sandbox' are also relevant technologies.
\par
This section presents an analysis of the firms that offer practical RegTech solutions for banks and other FIs. The majority of the RegTech firms investigated (40.6\%) deal with 'compliance management' issues.
\par
In the field of RegTech, the American company AxiomSL offers an integrated risk and regulatory compliance management platform for the financial industry. MetricStream offers cloud-based applications for governance, risk, and compliance management purposes, and Abside RegTech offers a combination of a software solution and consulting services.
\par
RegTech is still a very young scientific field, with only a few dozen articles published so far.
\par
Although scientific articles predominantly address technologies, companies tend to focus on the process view (compliance management). This is because compliance management activities are both costly and time intensive for FIs, and not being compliant can lead to the withdrawal of the banking license.
\par
A high share of journal articles cover regulatory reporting, and a lower share of investigated RegTech firms address this topic. A possible reason for this difference could be that the technological view is more present in science.
\par
One topic that is underrepresented in the scientific literature is identity management and control. RegTech firms offer customer identification solutions tailored to online customers.
\par
Banks and other FIs are overwhelmed by new and constantly changing regulations. RegTech solutions can assist in dealing with the regulatory burden in a more efficient manner, and the potential benefits of RegTech innovations are substantial.

RegTech applications are used mainly in financial institutions to enhance their risk and compliance management activities. These applications use artificial intelligence technologies that are primarily related to natural language processing.

Cloud computing is changing the way organizations approach technology and its infrastructure. The authors present a framework for balancing compliance pressures with cloud computing benefits, leading to less reported compliance violations.
\par
Given the increasing importance of IT in society, IT governance has been attracting attention in the last years from academics and practitioners alike. IT governance is based on several previous research fields, including corporate governance models, corporate strategies, IT knowledge of business divisions, and power of an IT organization.
\par
Benefits of IT governance have been reported largely in the literature, and include enabling IT-business alignment, which contributes to firm performance, and examining financial performance or relational performance.
\par
Given the crucial importance of the topic, researchers have built frameworks and initiatives devoted to IT governance, such as COBIT, MIT, and CMMI-SVC. The ISO38500:2008 standard was produced in May 2008 and includes three different tasks for IT governance: assessment, preparation and implementation of plans and policies, and monitoring of conformance.
\par
Cloud computing has changed the IT scenario profoundly. Security, trust, and privacy remain challenges for organizations that adopt cloud computing, and new privacy-related laws and regulations will be an aspect to consider among its adopters.
\par
Beyond regulations, there is a problem of compliance in cloud scenarios. This problem is rooted in the sheer number and complexity of laws and regulations that need to be observed in cloud settings, which creates opportunities and barriers towards service adoption and the market for cloud operators and tenant communities alike.
\par
Literature underlines the need to perform research on ways to help IT companies in the management of possible overlapping or conflicting regulatory compliance requirements. This paper presents a framework to help organizations manage compliance risks when adopting cloud scenarios.
\par
In this section, the framework for integrating aspects of compliance in cloud computing environments is introduced.
\par
The framework is aimed at providing compliance in cloud computing scenarios. It includes questionnaires for each of the five main aspects and an inner part that transforms inputs into a potential risks evaluation.
\par
A framework for the management of compliance risks in cloud scenarios is proposed, based on a proper classification of risks taken by such organizations with regards to compliance aspects. This framework is validated through two case studies.
\par
In this section, the framework for cloud compliance is introduced, along with its motivation and overall picture.
\par
The framework is aimed to provide compliance in cloud computing scenarios. It consists of five main aspects, each with a specific questionnaire, and an inner part that transforms the inputs into a potential risks evaluation.
\par
The authors customized the framework for the healthcare sector providers in Germany. A questionnaire was created to assess whether subcontracting can be used for significant data, and if so, what are the possibilities of data being available, confidential, or integrable? The questionnaire also assessed whether the provider had the required information security management system (ISMS). Controls are carried out regularly, and the security aspects are assessed regularly. Sanctions are foretasted, and access points for state agencies exist.
\par
In this case, the questionnaire is designed combining SOA governance models and SAM and includes questions such as: are there regulations for the introduction of the alteration in processes and in their steps? are security concepts taken into consideration when the alterations are taking place? The processes influenced by the Content Security Policy (CSP) are: "governance activities", "customer-facing activities", "core activities" and "support activities". The CSP must also provide information about security events and prepare log files.
\par
The questions present in the questionnaire are based on two different models: Wheeler's e-business innovation cycle and the technology acceptance model (TAM). TAM suggests that users come to accept and use technology through the evaluation of different factors.
\par
The adoption of a new technology is based on the user's attitude toward the behavior and subjective norms. The acceptance of a new technology is determined by perceived usefulness and perceived ease-of-use.
\par
The questionnaire is as follows: What are the feasible technologies for user and access management, role-based access control, two factor authentication, encryption at the time of data processing and data transportation, data backup, repair, and accessibility of the service?
\par
Technologies for data processing, data transportation, data backup, repair, accessibility, power supply, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, water supply, fire protection, vigorous structure, unnecessary network connection, emergency working places, etc.
\par
Technologies accessible for unnecessary data centers, documentation, and control of obtainability management, facility security, access control, and secure entrance area, promising server security, network security, application and platform security, information security, management of patch and change, customer data life cycle definition, isolation securely, information access based on role, etc. Routine backups, secure and complete removal, analysis of weaknesses and protection measures, use of random keys, secure exchange of keys, short key length, secure storage, two-factor authentication, and standardization of technologies are the accessible technologies aimed at ensuring encryption and key administration.
\par
The questionnaire is built in two different sources: the Cultural Orientations Framework and the cultural dimensions defined by Hofstede. It asks questions about the countries in which the main offices and branches of the organization are based, the main accounts they have, and their cultural aspects.
\par
The framework is designed to control changes on the overall architecture of adopters. ITIL is used to ensure that changes are registered, scheduled, and managed in an efficient way.
\par
To do so, the following steps are defined: identifying the significant information and procedures as main assets of the organization; identifying the secondary assets for the association along with metrics (inheritance); defining the security requirements for reflected information in cloud computing; and assessing the total risk.
\par
The distribution effect lowers the classification of a resource when its area of application is spread over a number of other resources.
\par
To confirm the validity of a framework, it is necessary to obtain the opinion of multiple experts of the field. This method automatically results in a qualitative approach, with techniques that include important interactions with people directly experiencing the phenomena under study.
\par
The validation of the framework elements was performed by separate groups of professionals in their respective fields. The selection criteria are included in Table 2.
\par
The experts were provided with a detailed description of the proposed framework, and were asked to provide input on whether the framework was an adequate tool to describe risks. The result of this validation was a set of changes in the inclusion or exclusion of questions, clarifications of terms, and rewording.
\par
The experts emphasized the importance of concise description of legal fields, precise procedure classifications from the organizational point of view, KPIs relevant to particular techniques, and an extended quantification-oriented method of the questionnaire.
\par
A questionnaire was designed and sent via email to the experts to get their opinion on the framework.
\par
Experts were chosen from academia and the industry, based on previous working connections and personal relationships. They were fully informed about the implications of their participation in the research.
\par
The main results from the assessment of the questionnaires are that the framework goals are encouraging, that the methodology is suitable, that the theoretical innovation is significant, that the framework can be applied to other projects, and that the maintainability of the framework should be considered.
\par
The goal of the evaluation is to compare the performance of the institutional change management in a cloud service setting before and after introduction of the proposed framework.
\par
The organization in which the mentioned evaluation is carried out must meet specific criteria, including maturity of IT processes, ownership by the private sector, and assurance of implementing the framework within the organization in such a way that it becomes full and sincere.
\par
Two organizations agreed to participate in the evaluation. The aims of both organizations to adopt the framework are to prevent conformity-gaps between requirements and their real implementation in IT, to increase the capability in articulating its own IT compliance to present and potential customers, and to assure compliance of IT processes. A compliance evaluation sheet was designed and sent to both organizations in the pre (I) and post (II) framework adoption phases. The sheet includes information on participant, compliance management, overall satisfaction with compliance management in CC, overall satisfaction with CC service, and overall insight into the influence of compliance management in CC on organizational compliance management procedures.
\par
The mean values are higher in Phase II compared to Phase I, while standard deviations differ. The satisfaction rate is higher in Phase II than in Phase I.
\par
The Student's t-test was used to compare results between phases.
\par
The compliance metrics indicate a minor difference in the average time span between identification of external compliance issues and resolution after implementing the framework.
\par
Phase 2 demonstrated an increase in the number of compliance problems in which employees required advice or support, however, the differences are very minor.
\par
The number of violations reduced from 89 to 60 (32.59\%), although the sample size was small.
\par
Ten respondents answered the Compliance Evaluation Sheet, and the descriptive statistics are shown in Table 5.
\par
Overall, the means are higher in Phase II than in Phase I, and the standard deviations differ. However, there is a statistical difference in the third aspect of CM's contribution to the IT quality of service.
\par
The main aspect of the compliance metrics is the average time span between identification of external compliance issues and resolution. Phase 2 illustrates a minor difference.
\par
Phase 2 of the framework decreased the number of compliance issues where employees asked for support.
\par
The number of reports of supposed or actual compliance violations reduced from 76 to 58 (23.78\%).
\par
The mean values are higher in Phase II, and the standard deviation presents different values in the variables and cases. The Student's t-test shows that three of the four variables present significant values.
\par
The Compliance Evaluation Sheets indicate that the average value of the satisfaction and contribution are higher in Phase II after use, indicating that the framework is positive in the dimensions under consideration. The satisfaction with the cloud service was also higher, but with less variations in the standard deviation scores.
\par
The authors of the paper underline that the results are credible from the participants' viewpoint to believably rule out different explanations. However, the limited number of subjects could harm the transferability of the results.
\par
The authors assigned an external auditor in the process to increase the extent to which results could be corroborated, and the validity of the framework was assessed by experts. The sample size was modest, but the authors believe it was significant enough to assess the framework.
\par
The proposed framework for cloud computing compliance can be customized for different functional domains, and can be mapped with relevant standards and initiatives on IT governance, including ISO 38500 or COBIT. It can also be implemented in various settings to compare national and organizational cultures.},

  abstract = {The aim of this Web-based survey of 15 German companies with an international profile was to identify which higher-level values serve as a basis for a company culture that promotes integrity and can thereby also be used to promote crime prevention. Results on about 2000 managers in German parent companies and almost 600 managers in Central and North European branch offices show that a major preventive role can be assigned to a company culture that promotes integrity. This requires a `tone from the top', `ethical leadership' from the direct superior, and a general set of values that can be encouraged through training courses. Moreover, employees have to perceive these values as promoting their careers. The survey reveals that the companies in this study have basically succeeded in establishing their system of values in their Central and North European as well as their Asian branch offices. Moreover, it shows that the main values preventing crime on the management level are trustworthiness and consistency. Open communication is an important value on all levels of a company, and this is supplemented by transparency, compliance with the rules, and a rejection of behaving in one's own interest. It is concluded that in spite of regional differences, major international companies can possibly make an important contribution to bringing about cultural change in regions with an affinity for corruption by implementing a culture that promotes integrity in both their company and their daily business.},

We faced the challenge of building a compliance management system for a process-aware organisation and identified several needs that, despite having been identified in the literature, were only partially satisfied by existing approaches. The variability in the types of rules generally restricts the existing support for compliance checking to specific types of rules, a concrete phase of the business process management lifecycle, or certain information systems (ISs) for data retrieval. Motivated by this, we designed a conceptual framework for compliance checking that relies on the use of mashups for rule specification and checking, with the following advantages: (i) an open-ended set of rules can be specified by designing and connecting mashup components; (ii) (parts of) the definitions of the rules can be reused as needed; and (iii) the mashup-based compliance checking system can be integrated with ISs of the organisation, enabling the verification of actual facts on actions performed during the execution of a process (e.g., the existence of a document in a location). Design-time and run-time implementations of the framework were conducted and tested in a real setting. IEEE},

Manual compliance checking is challenging because there are numerous requirements with changing nature and different purposes.

In this paper, we characterize the methods for automatic compliance checking of software processes, including used techniques, potential impacts, and challenges. For this, we undertake a systematic literature review (SLR) of studies reporting methods in this field. As a result, we identify solutions that use different techniques (e.g., anthologies and metamodels) to represent processes and their artifacts (e.g., tasks and roles). Various languages, which have diverse capabilities for managing competing and changing norms, and agile strategies, are also used to represent normative requirements. Most solutions require tool-support concretization and enhanced capabilities to handle processes and normative diversity. Our findings outline compelling areas for future research. In particular, there is a need to select suitable languages for consolidating a generic and normative-agnostic solution, increase automation levels, tool support, and boost the application in practice by improving usability aspects.},

  abstract = {Monitoring compliance status by an organization has been historically difficult due to the growing number of compliance requirements being imposed by various standards, frameworks, and regulatory requirements. Existing practices by organizations even with the assistance of security tools and appliances is mostly manual in nature as there is still a need for a human expert to interpret and map the reports generated by various solutions to actual requirements as stated in various compliance documents. As the number of requirements increases, this process is becoming either too costly or impractical to manage by the organization. Aside from the numerous requirements, multiple of these documents actually overlap in terms of domains and actual requirements. However, since current tools do not directly map and highlight overlaps as well as generate detailed gap reports, an organization would perform compliance activities redundantly across multiple requirements thereby increasing cost as well. In this paper, we present an approach that attempts to provide an end-to-end solution from compliance document requirements to actual verification and validation of implementation for audit purposes with the intention of automating compliance status monitoring as well as providing the ability to have continuous compliance monitoring as well as reducing the redundant efforts that an organization embarks on for multiple compliance requirements.

\par
Organizations have historically struggled to monitor compliance status due to the growing number of compliance requirements. This paper presents a method for automating compliance status monitoring as well as providing the ability to continuously monitor compliance statuses as well as allowing for reusability via conceptual mapping of multiple standards and requirements.
\par
The need to conduct compliance activities within an organization has never been more apparent than it is in recent times. The number of regulations, standards, frameworks, architectures, and practices that an organization must comply with is overwhelming.
\par
Although requirements are increasing, there are also many commonalities among them, and organizations are attempting to improve on their compliance practices by minimizing redundant new organizational units within the organization. However, many compliance monitoring systems still rely heavily on human or expert intervention.
\par
Several ontology models for information security, compliance and policy concepts already exist. However, these models do not capture the concepts that can be seen in the actual compliance requirements statements.
\par
This paper presents a framework for continuous compliance monitoring for multiple requirements documents using test cases and unit testing frameworks based on software quality assurance and secure software development lifecycle methodologies. The framework can be used to generate reports showing specific deficiencies in compliance based on document requirements.
\par
Most tools focus on technical compliance requirements and generate compliance reports based on templates. However, these reports do not consider prevention and recovery controls and user awareness when determining if an organization is compliant with ISO 27001 or PCIDSS.
\par
Existing security and compliance ontologies model domain concepts such as controls in its ideal end state. However, compliance documents also state concepts like actions that need to be performed and conditions that need to be met.
\par
The goal of this research is to improve the granularity of compliance assessment by focusing on the leaf nodes of the document structure. This research aims to identify the differences and redundancies among requirements in order to identify gaps and similar requirements.
\par
This research attempted to model compliance as per the compliance documents. It showed that there were conceptual overlaps between the documents, but current attempts are done manually and there is no definitive granular mapping that can illustrate exact overlaps and gaps among different compliance requirements.
\par
Multiple efforts have been made to define ontologies that can be used in security and compliance activities. However, these ontologies are not linked to the compliance documents and focus on technical aspects or general concepts of information security.
\par
The compliance documents include controls and actions, and the controls can be applied to other objects in the organization. The documents also contain phrases like "regularly update", "periodic evaluation", "commonly affected", and "strong encryption".
\par
The hierarchy of controls is introduced in order to tackle the complete compliance requirements rather than focusing solely on the technical aspects of controls and compliance. The motivation behind modeling organizational and administrative controls is that scripts can be developed to automatically verify if the controls are being implemented.
\par
To reduce redundant or repetitive efforts in compliance enforcement and audit, the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit was used to extract information from compliance documents using natural language processing tools. The resulting dependency tree was then used to populate the enhanced compliance ontology.
\par
The ROOT is extracted as ACTION. If there is an immediate child node with POS of CC and SD of CC, the ACTION is also extracted.
\par
The Stanford CoreNLP tool produces incorrect tags for the root identified in Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT)5. A possible resolution is to split the COBIT5 activity into individual goals and individual assets to provide a more accurate result.
\par
Automation scripts are needed to link compliance requirements to implementation verification and to provide real-time compliance status feedback. Existing tools that monitor compliance map to industry practices, but cannot show areas of compliance and deficiencies with respect to compliance requirements.
\par
Windows Powershell was used to implement the proof-of-concept to monitor compliance for a varied set of tools and controls. Scripts were mapped to compliance documents to provide a common vocabulary for mapping and translation of requirements through the enhanced ontology.
\par
The audit scripts are formalized through the use of test cases in testing frameworks used in software quality assurance, and can be used to support compliance requirements statements such as "Deploy antivirus software on all systems commonly affected by malicious software" (PCIDSS v3.2).
\par
The research aims to link compliance requirements to tickets within a project management tool to monitor compliance and generate documentary evidence for compliance audits.
\par
To validate the research, information was extracted from an existing GRC system, and an enhanced ontology was developed. This ontology was integrated with an existing GRC system, and audit scripts were validated with respect to compliance statements.
\par
The current results of the information extraction and ontology population from 356 compliance requirements statements using CoreNLP showed an average accuracy of 69.38\% (247 statements). However, challenges still exist in identifying the remaining concepts of the enhanced ontology from compliance documents.
\par
Scripts have been developed to support various compliance requirements, including checking antivirus deployment status, checking installed software, checking hardware inventory, and network scanning. These scripts can be used to determine compliance with PCIDSS and ISO 27002:2013.
\par
The IJACSA framework has been identified and defined, but further research is needed to validate the use of heuristics in audit scripts to improve compliance.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the complexity and scale of compliance requirements has grown significantly due to globalization as well as maturing of different fields and regulations. However, there remains a gap between compliance management tools and security management tools whereby the later cannot be directly linked to the former as the focus and terminologies used are very different. The tasks of mapping security implementations to compliance requirements that will allow compliance monitoring and management is therefore performed manually and repeatedly across multiple standards, regulations, and organizations. This process is highly inefficient, costly, and does not allow for management to determine compliance levels and gaps in a continuous and automated manner. In this paper, we present an approach that combines ontology mapping, natural language processing, secure systems development lifecycle, and heuristics to allow for mapping of security controls and activities to compliance documents such as standards and regulations to focus on compliance and support continuous compliance management and monitoring as well as reduce the compliance efforts needed in multiple standards compliance by allowing reusability via conceptual mapping of multiple standards and requirements.

While there has been a plethora of works regarding this actual verification of process models relative to business rules, we see a strong lack of works regarding the actual creation and maintenance of business rules. More precisely, many works assume sound sets of business rules as a basis for subsequent techniques. However, recent works suggest this assumption cannot be made in practice, and companies actually need to be supported in the scope of managing and organizing business rules, e. g. to remove redundant or contradictory rules. Otherwise, errors in business rules make these rule bases unusable and impede a subsequent verification of process compliance. Yet, the understanding on business rule organization is sparse - especially its relation to BPC. To address this issue on a conceptual level, we develop a taxonomy for business rule organizing approaches. Furthermore, we identify rule organizing approaches from literature based on a systematic literature review and classify these works in the scope of the developed taxonomy. Based on the identified literature, we also identify research gaps and propose a corresponding research agenda.},

\par
This paper aims to present a review of the academic literature on the ISO/ IEC 27001 standard.
\par
The study presents a structured overview of the academic body of knowledge on ISO/IEC 27001, and outlines research opportunities for future studies.
\par
As economy and society become increasingly data-driven, holistic approaches to information system security are required to balance trade-off decisions between protection and legal compliance, and cost and operational agility.
\par
Despite an increasing practitioners' interest in the topic, ISS is still perceived in academia as an essentially technical topic. Several organizations ask their business partners to be ISO/IEC 27001 certified, including Apple Internet Services, Amazon Web Services, GE Digital, several Microsoft business units and - more recently - Facebook's Workplace.
\par
The literature on ISS standards is marked by ongoing concerns about their efficacy and validation. We believe that more interdisciplinarity is necessary to study ISS standards in light of the COVID-19 health crisis.
\par
This study moves in the direction of developing a systematic literature review on ISO/IEC 27001. It does so by combining three system theoretical approaches to the study of ISO/IEC 27001 and by allowing scientific exchange beyond what is already present.
\par
This study presents a comprehensive overview of the body of knowledge on ISO/IEC 27001, and adds a novel analytical perspective through the lenses of social systems thinking.
\par
This paper discusses the practical implications of the ISO/IEC 27001 standard for managers and policymakers, including the need to consider ISS needs and practices in the broader business environment.
\par
The remainder of the paper presents the results of the literature review, followed by a discussion of the main issues and a theory-based research agenda.
\par
We used a systematic approach to analyze the literature on management system standards, following the guidelines of Tranfield et al. (2003), Rousseau et al. (2008) and Seuring and Gold (2012).
\par
We performed a formal search on multiple online scientific databases, screened the abstracts and full texts for their fit with the objectives of the study, and identified 96 contributions.
\par
We performed a content analysis on journal articles based on year, publication outlet, disciplinary area, authors' affiliation/geography, methodology and underpinning theory. We identified main themes and sub-themes through deductive and inductive coding, and identified the relevant passages for each paper.
\par
The results of the coding activity were examined, and a synthesis of the relevant passages reported in the literature for each sub-theme was prepared.
\par
The review focuses on the IS literature and shows that most authors belong to institutions located in European countries.
\par
The vast majority of papers has a conceptual nature, and few papers built on established theories, such as the circuit of power framework, the resource-based view, and the crisis management theory.
\par
The vast majority of journal articles examine ISO/IEC 27001 together with other ISS standards and management certifications.
\par
Standards for information security may cover non-IT assets, have a technological connotation, or target specific IS layers and related safeguards. Several studies indicate complementarities and synergies between ISO/IEC 27001 and other standards/frameworks.
\par
Several papers suggest harmonization methods for several ISS standards, including ISO/IEC 27001, Mesquida et al. (2014), Pardo et al. (2012), Leszczyna (2019) and Al-Karaki et al. (2020).
\par
The integration of other ISO management system standards, especially ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18001, has been analyzed in the literature. The integration of ISO/IEC 27001 and other ISO management systems may result in better outcomes, but may also cause terminology, structure, and scope misalignments.
\par
In the literature on voluntary standards, significant attention has been paid to the motivations driving organizations in the pursuit of certifications. These motivations are classified as functionalist and institutionalist.
\par
Most studies report functionalist motivations for implementing an information system management system. These motivations include higher levels of ISS, the acquisition of new skills and competences, and more efficiency in the processes related to information management.
\par
Several authors report expectations for a better corporate image through the attainment of the certification. This in turn attracts more customers and consolidates client relationships.
\par
In the UK, information security scandals have raised public awareness. Therefore, several companies pursue an informal implementation of ISO/IEC 27001, but do not seek the certification.
\par
The presence of governmental regulatory and promotion activities fostering ISO/IEC 27001 diffusion is mentioned in the studies. These activities have contributed to the dissemination of ISS awareness and some of them have fostered explicitly the ISO/IEC 27001 certification.
\par
Some studies point to isomorphic dynamics in the adoption of ISO/IEC 27001, and this dynamic is reinforced by the global reputation of the ISO umbrella of standards.
\par
Studies report issues and opportunities related to the implementation of ISO/IEC 27001, and the main themes are: (1) how effectively ISO/IEC 27001 tools and methods provide support to the implementing organization; (2) how do organizations structure the project governance; and (3) what differences in the actual adoption of practices have been documented.
\par
Although the current version of the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 addresses the main problems highlighted by previous research, it still lacks guidance on the mutual interdependence among the different control items, and on the identification of the most relevant controls given the characteristics and the context of the implementing organization.
\par
ISO/IEC 27001 supports organizations in aligning their ISMS to local legislation, but lacks precise instructions on how to comply with multiple local legislations, and does not provide adequate guidance on cultural and psychological dimensions relevant for ensuring employees' compliance.
\par
The studies show that IT, organizational and legal competencies are necessary for ISO/IEC 27001 implementation, and that companies need to formulate well-defined coordination mechanisms.
\par
The process to obtain the ISO/IEC 27001 certification usually absorbs significant company resources.
\par
The last theme emerging from our review concerns the possibility of differences in the actual adoption of practices. This is a key research area in relation to other standards and voluntary initiatives, but few studies addressed specifically the question with regard to ISO/IEC 27001.
\par
Few studies have cited the outcomes of the ISO/IEC 27001 certification. Only three studies focus explicitly on the impact of the standard.
\par
The paper discusses the benefits of ISO/IEC 27001 in a competitive setting and in a company's organizational and financial performance. It also reports that the certification may prevent the leaking of private information to unauthorized parties and subsequent legal actions, bad publicity and profit losses.
\par
Two papers correlate ISO/IEC 27001 diffusion with country-level indicators. The economic sentiment indicator and industrial property rights granted are positively associated with ISO certification.
\par
Most papers stress international and governmental initiatives fostering the diffusion of ISO/IEC 27001, but some studies also highlight higher adoption in offshored countries, and cultural differences in relation to employees' attitudes toward ISMS compliance.
\par
The literature mentions differences based on organization size. However, only large companies assign sufficient priority to ISS due to resource availability.
\par
The standard is generic by design, but might not be suitable for organizations deviating the most from this average profile.
\par
ISO/IEC 27001 is more frequent in the IT sector, but less frequent in other industries. It is often perceived as applicable only to highly digitalized contexts, and may not be sufficient to guarantee IS security and safety.
\par
The literature highlights the presence of contingencies related to the organizational culture, and cultural change is identified as the main challenge to overcome in ISS implementation.
\par
The results of the analysis of the books and book chapters on ISO/IEC 27001 are consistent with the themes emerging from the coding of academic articles.
\par
This systematic review helps to clarify the main themes and results elaborated in almost 15 years of academic research on ISO/IEC 27001, and shows that the standard is related to governmental incentives and market demands, as well as to motivations and implementation challenges.
\par
The scale and scope of interorganizational collaborations is posing new challenges to information security. Online platforms and tech giants are connecting vast numbers of suppliers and customers, implying massive outsourcing of data storage and computing capabilities.
\par
The COVID-19 pandemic is causing immense stress on ISS controls and operations, as more and more work-from-home arrangements, customer-facing networks and online services are used. This is causing concerns about contact-tracing applications that could misuse personal and biometric data.
\par
In a world where organizational boundaries are increasingly meaningless, ISO/IEC 27001 is becoming obsolete. It may be useful to integrate other standards, frameworks and not-standardized practices on the structure of ISO/IEC 27001 for more comprehensive approaches.
\par
We believe that the study of ISO/IEC 27001 needs to shift from "the part" to "the whole" to address the issues of certification, expectations of image improvements and better relations with key stakeholders.
\par
Several theories have been used to study voluntary standards adoption, implementation and performance. The most prominent ones are transaction cost theory (Coase, 1937), resource-based view (Penrose, 1959), institutional theory (Meyer and Rowan 1977), signaling theory (Spence 1973) and stakeholder theory (Freeman 1984).
\par
We believe that future research should not be limited to the study of ISO/IEC 27001 within single organizations, but also address its role within the suite of ISS practices and standards.
\par
We have outlined four overarching research areas with different scopes based on the tenets of social systems thinking. This framework is targeted at academics from different backgrounds.
\par
A system is a set of interrelated elements that functions as a whole and adapts to changes in the environmental conditions.
\par
Using the congruence systems model, it is possible to consider both the suite of standards, formal and informal practices - including ISO/IEC 27001 - that are implemented by organizations to manage ISS and cybersecurity.
\par
The effectiveness of an information security management system can be improved by integrating multiple standards, including ISO/IEC 27001, and by analyzing the congruence between requirements and actual practices.
\par
The second system-level view is useful for analyzing how ISO/IEC 27001 supports ISS in a context characterized by inter-organizational information flows. Two theoretical lenses, collaborative systems and complex adaptive systems, can be used to analyze this issue.
\par
Collaborative systems are based on the general principle that organizational structures and processes need to adapt against changes in the economic, technological and regulatory environment. Individual organizations can opt for internal solutions, or pursue joint initiatives.
\par
CAS is conceptualized as dynamic networks of autonomous agents that interact with one another and with their environment to produce evolving systems. ISO/IEC 27001 is a norm that limits the freedom of individual agents within the network to achieve higher system efficiency.
\par
The current pandemic triggered changes in the network triggered by social systems thinking. We believe that our reasoning may provide a fresh perspective on the knowledge gaps on ISO/IEC 27001.

This study discussed the state of the literature on ISO/IEC 27001 and formulated a theory-based research agenda grounded in social systems thinking.
\par
This paper contributes to the academic literature on ISO/IEC 27001 by highlighting emerging themes and open issues and by indicating a set of research opportunities. It also problematizes the assumption behind ISO/IEC 27001 research as a firm-level phenomenon.
\par
This study provides a comprehensive overview on the body of knowledge on the ISO/IEC 27001 standard. It argues that a system-level view is needed in order to understand the implications of being certified and the role major international standards play in providing guidance against an ever-increasing complexity.},

\par
In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, techniques and algorithms for automated compliance checking are continually being improved, generalized and flexible with the use of semantic and logic-based representations. However, there is still a lack of research that addresses advances in ACC tools headed for the I4.0 perspective.
\par
Manual regulatory compliance checking is costly and error-prone, and non-compliance can result in penalties, fines, or even fatalities. Therefore, public and private entities recognize the need for minimization of errors in the legal compliance checking procedure in their business management systems.
\par
The industrial production is currently experiencing the fourth revolution, which is known as Industry 4.0. This revolution allows the development of new technologies to improve communication between entities in a novel interaction scenario, but also raises several concerns regarding security, legal and privacy subjects.
\par
ACC is an effective strategy for regulatory compliance checking, but challenges include retrieval of required information in its correct representation, the required preprocessing for each strategy, and the use of hard-coded and proprietary rules for representing regulatory requirements.
\par
ACC has been integrated with semantic natural language processing techniques and design information in building information models, and is now being combined with a semantic enrichment process or machine learning/deep learning algorithms. It can support compliance to ethics and can play a significant role in the success of service interoperation.
\par
In I4.0 several different approaches can be used to automate quality control, but it is difficult to use the most appropriate technology. This study aims to fill these gaps by mapping ACC technologies and ranking them using fuzzy group decision-making approaches.
\par
This article surveys compliance checking technologies from the I4.0 perspective and compares cutting edge automated compliance checking technologies.
\par
To achieve the study' purposes, a systematic review was conducted, followed by a content analysis based on empirical research methods. A bibliographic portfolio was then evaluated by quantitative and qualitative content analysis methods, and hybrid multi-criteria decision-making techniques were implemented to rank the results.
\par
We used the CIMO framework to formulate a research question and then selected the studies that addressed our research question.
\par
The research was conducted from January to April 2019 using a set of terms to search for relevant studies in engineering and business fields.
\par
In order to generate the sample of the BP, 38 articles were analyzed in depth (full-text analysis) in an iterative process. Based on the analysis, a content analysis was performed on these 38 articles to obtain the thematic synthesis of the content related to ACC.
\par
Multi-criteria decision-making is a set of methods and techniques to help individuals and organizations make decisions under the influence of several criteria.
\par
Five elegant groups of multi-criteria decision-making methods have been proposed in the literature: scoring methods, pairwise comparison methods, outranking methods, distance-based methods, utility methods. The acronym MAUT stands for multi-attribute utility theory. The ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalite (ELECTRE) is a multi-criteria aggregation procedure that compares alternatives in an exploitation process. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) are popular pairwise comparison methods.
\par
MCDM can be used to solve four kinds of decision problems: choice, sorting, ranking, and grading.
\par
In order to aid practitioners, decision-makers and academics in choosing the proper automated compliance technologies, MCDM techniques were used to elaborate the alternatives, build a set of criteria and determine the performance of all or some alternatives taking into account additional information.
\par
To solve ranking problems, additive aggregation methods are commonly used, such as the VIKOR method and the TOPSIS method. These methods use different normalization techniques, which result in different results.
\par
The AHP method was used to evaluate a decision-making process based on multiple attributes in a hierarchical system, but it relies on a subjective nature and does not take into consideration the uncertainty in judgment due to natural language.
\par
Pedrycz (1983) proposed a fuzzy priority theory based on fuzzy set theory for MCDM, in which a fuzzy number is defined as a connected set of possible values concerning a generalized real number.
\par
Fuzzy AHP is used in multi-criteria group decision-making problems to address the issue of imprecise and vague information regarding the judgment of decision-makers.
\par
The fuzzy members W and U are real numbers respecting the relation lmu, and the algebraic operations W U 1 4 lW lU mU uU are defined as W U .
\par
We consider triangular membership functions when implementing FAHP, and express the assembly as a function of the fuzzy set relation with the criteria.
\par
The fuzzy geometric mean is defined for each value of the matrix A.
\par
The center of area method is used to obtain the crisp priority vector from the fuzzy set resulting from the aggregation.
\par
TOPSIS is a method for ranking multiple alternatives by their similarity toward an ideal choice. It was developed by Hwang and Yoon (1981) and minimizes the positive ideal solution distance and maximizes the negative ideal solution distance.
\par
The TOPSIS technique can be expressed as follows: - Step 1: Define the objectives; - Step 2: Develop the decision matrix.
\par
Step 4: Identify the ideal solution and step 5: Identify the ideal solution and step 6.
\par
TOPSIS has been modified and extended, and even though it has been compared with other MCDM methods. VIKOR is an alternative to TOPSIS.
\par
The VIKOR method aims to rank and select a set of alternatives under inconsistent criteria and was introduced in 1998 by Serafim Opricovic. Its advantages include the capacity of obtaining a compromise solution with the maximum group utility of a ''majority'' while maintaining a minimum of an individual regret.
\par
The VIKOR method uses a constant value of m to aid in the strategy used in the decision. The ranked lists represent the maximum group utility, minimum individual regret and the strategy parameter.
\par
The two MCDM methods TOPSIS and VIKOR use different techniques for criteria normalization, aggregation and solution. FAHP-TOPSIS and FAHP-VIKOR use a hybrid model combining FAHP, TOPSIS and VIKOR methods for weight allocation and ranking the most suitable ACC tool based on expert evaluation.
\par
A bibliometric study was conducted on 38 papers regarding automated rule checking in several industrial fields from 2005 to 2019.
\par
Several machine learning techniques are being refined to increase the reliability of the automated compliance checking process.
\par
This study collected information on three main text processing groups: declarative rule processing (DRP), flow-based processing (FBP) and natural language processing (NLP). The dispersion of ACC-related studies across the research time period is shown in figure 3.
\par
The literature sample is related to AEC, business, computer science and legal domains, with 47.7\% using DRP, 27.3\% using FBP and 25\% using NLP as the main text process technique.
\par
The analysis of the SLR brought important information concerning compliance control. It is observed that proprietary tools are prone to FBP, while open-source frameworks are adept to DRP or NLP techniques.
\par
This section analyzes the results from the SLR through the perspective of specialists, and uses linguistic variables to deal with uncertainty in group decision-making.
\par
Nine interviews were conducted with a group of specialists to discuss criteria definition. The participants were required to have previous experience with strict norm sectors such as construction, energy and product development.
\par
The results obtained were quantified and the experts ranked the currently available technologies to perform ACC.
\par
The fuzzy priority vector is obtained by the triangular membership function by taking the minimum, modal and maximum values from the results obtained with the interviews with specialists to define the criteria hierarchy.
\par
TOPSIS and VIKOR require a priority direction vector. The constant value (m = 0.5) is also considered.
\par
Expert's judgment indicates that the FAHP-TOPSIS and FAHP-VIKOR hybrid multi-criteria methods produce similar rankings for ACC, indicating that both methods consider weight stability fluctuations and consensus among decision-makers.
\par
Bagheri et al. (2018) observed that the VIKOR and TOPSIS methods provide similar outputs for a small set of alternatives. Shekhovtsov and Salabun (2020) observed that the likelihood of obtaining similar results decreases with the increase in decision options.
\par
Ploskas and Papathanasiou (2019) applied TOPSIS and VIKOR methods to select the most appropriate employee, and found that all methods found the same two top ranking alternatives.
\par
The most suitable technology for performing adaptive control is an open-source tool, but it requires significant investment of technical expertise. Open-source tools are also less expensive than proprietary software packages, and there are well-established communities of practice that provide technical support.
\par
This study surveyed 102 articles concerning the automation of regulatory compliance checking among the I4.0 era. It found seven technologies capable of performing ACC, and three main taxonomies frequently used for ACC.
\par
The literature review shows that new ACC technologies can boost regulatory compliance checking, and that there are seven technologies that can be implemented to fill ACC gaps.
\par
We ranked ACC technologies using two hybrid multi-criteria methods and observed that open-source technologies and those that use natural language processing are better evaluated.
\par
Future research should integrate ACC with text classification techniques and adaptative approaches for rule reasoning in text processing. Moreover, hesitant fuzzy sets could be used to avoid the difficulty created when calculating the criteria weights using AHP and ranking MCDM methods.
\par
Symbolic algorithms are effective ACC tools, as they are easily human-interpretable, and proceed with word embedding analysis and model classification techniques suitable for a desirable purpose.},

  abstract = {Based on years of ethnographic research about compliance management practice in China's pharmaceutical industry, this article examines the reaction of Western transnational companies and Chinese workers to recent changes of managerial control in the socialist workplace. Although academic research on China's labor studies has fully explored the areas, such as traditional manufacturing, little is known about the new changes of management-labor practices in China's pharmaceutical market. Following the labor process theory, this article argues that compliance management sounds neat and modern in the context of China, but in practice, the management and workers have ``hypocritical'' and ``paradoxical'' reactions to it. Although the transnational pharmaceutical companies attempt to discipline Sales Representatives to work within China's policies and regulations around pharmaceutical marketing, the management also flexibly permits Sales Representatives to engage in informal practices to earn profits. Meanwhile, Sales Representatives have developed a new kind of subjectivity that compels them to ``consent'' to this new managerial control. \textcopyright{} 2021 by De La Salle University.},

wordtune summary
\par
China is the second-largest pharmaceutical market in the world, and transnational pharmaceutical companies (TPCs) dominate this market. Since the 2013 GSK bribery scandal, TPCs have introduced a proliferation of corporate policies against business corruption based on a series of legal and ethical conduct.
\par
This article explores how compliance management is a new management practice in the socialist workplace. It argues that while the TPCs attempt to discipline Sales Representatives to work within China's policies and regulations around pharmaceutical marketing, they also permit informal practices to earn profits.
\par
Current research on management-labor relations of Chinese business focuses on traditional manufacturing, but there is little research on changes in industrial relations in the pharmaceutical industry. This study focuses on the compliance management operated by Western capital-invested enterprises in China's pharmaceutical industry.
\par
The original ideas of the labor process theory come from Marx's Capital. However, Braverman's (1974) research on Labor and Monopoly Capital has initially aroused the enthusiasm of the academic community in the true sense of the labor process theory.
\par
Braverman's (1974) study of labor process only shows how capital grabs surplus-value, but fails to notice how capital disguises surplus-value and constructs its legitimacy. Michael Burawoy's (1985) study of politics of production emphasizes the subjective experience of workers in the labor process.
\par
Knights (1990) argued that modern labor management techniques (hierarchical surveillance, normalization, and examination) shape workers' subjectivity and make them feel uncertain and insecure about their identity. This makes it harder for workers to unite and get rid of capitalist exploitation.
\par
Based on classic Western labor theories, more and more scholars began to study Chinese labor since the 1990s. Among them, the research of most scholars focuses on the traditional manufacturing industries in Chinese business, and the research of some scholars also focus on construction, service, and the internet industries.
\par
In recent years, the Chinese people have become more concerned with medical bills, access to quality medical services, doctors making a living by selling drugs, and drug prices. This study explores management practices in the pharmaceutical industry in China.
\par
The classical labor process research has adopted the case studies, but the extended case method and reflexive science in sociology utilize participant observation to understand people's lived experiences in specific social and historical contexts.
\par
In this study, I chose Company X (China branch) as the main site of fieldwork. Upper management and lower workers conducted independent research on the management practices of Company X to discover the influence of macro power on micro life.
\par
This study adopted diversified methods of collecting data, including five years of work experience, 75 follow-up interviews with Company X's Sales Representatives, sales managers, and compliance officers, and informal oral interviews with doctors and other TPCs' Sales Representatives.
\par
There were many difficulties in the process of data collection, as some interviewees were unwilling to accept the interview invitation, and some Sales Representatives avoided talking about sensitive topics with doctors.
\par
China's pharmaceutical market transformation has gradually formed a "hypocritical and paradoxical" disciplinary labor regime. This system is similar to Anita Chan's (2000) notion of the "consensus management style".
\par
Before the 2013 GSK event, the Chinese pharmaceutical market was chaotic, with both TPCs and local pharmaceutical companies sharing the same sales model characterized by "relationship marketing" and "sales with commissions".
\par
The 2013 GSK bribery scandal was a major event in China's pharmaceutical industry, which resulted in great changes in policymaking, legal obligations, business ethics, and management practices.
\par
Under the strong influence of state policies, academic conference promotion has become the new marketing approach for TPCs. The transformation of the labor process is accompanied by changes in labor relations and management practices, and the term compliance management has become a new concept for the management and workers in China.
\par
In order to control the non-compliant sales practices of MICSs in the sales process, Company X took the lead in synchronizing its standard global internal self-regulation system - compliance management - to the Chinese market. However, the compliance management of Company X has been exercised with reservations.
\par
Change 1: From "Sales with Commissions" to "Academic Conference Promotion" Foreign and domestic pharmaceutical companies operating in China are all strongly sales-oriented. However, after the GSK event, commercial bribery had become a business taboo in the Chinese pharmaceutical industry.
\par
Company X continuously adjusted its marketing strategies to ensure that MICSs legally do business. However, the company's new policy of requiring MICSs to hold pre-approved academic conferences is nothing more than a hypocritical performance by the Sales Representatives to meet the compliance inspection.
\par
Change 2: A Joint Audit System to End More Fake Conferences The financial audit system in Company X frequently causes financial and compliance issues, so a compliance division was set up to strengthen the audit process.
\par
The compliance ombudsman checks whether the receipts are complete and authentic, and performs on-site conference checking without advanced notice to reaffirm the authenticity of these conferences. However, the system of spot-checking is prone to some loopholes, and internal employees manage compliance affairs.
\par
In China's pharmaceutical industry, sales managers use two methods to monitor the daily work of sales representatives: phone spot-checking and hospital follow-up. However, some companies have turned their customer relationship management system into a tool for tracking and monitoring sales representatives.
\par
In the past, Company X only paid attention to the management of MICSs' sales performance and ignored the management of individual sales behavior, which led to many cases of non-compliant actions. After the GSK event, Company X introduced the yifang system to manage MICSs' sales behavior.
\par
In China, compliance management is full of contradictions: on the one hand, TPCs are under pressure from the outside to comply with government regulation, but on the other hand, TPCs turn a blind eye to informal sales practices.
\par
The neglect of workers' subjectivity in labor process research has always been the core criticism of recent labor process research. Michael Burawoy (1979) made a compelling case study to understand the significance of workers' subjectivity in the labor process.
\par
In China's pharmaceutical industry, 70\% of the company's employees work in the sales department, wherein salespeople are the main targets of capital management controls. Salespeople have a high degree of freedom in their work.
\par
Sales Representatives in the pharmaceutical industry must identify and locate crucial departments and clients according to the products they are responsible for. They must also select some key attending doctors and resident doctors for each target department.
\par
The doctors have finished ward rounds and gone back to their offices. The MICSs usually visit VIP clients during this time.
\par
The MICS can collect information about patients from resident doctors during a less busy time in the hospital.
\par
The time after work is the best time for MICSs to learn about patients' information and improve their relationship with doctors.
\par
Sales representatives are required to select their target departments and clients independently, and are held accountable for everything that happens in the hospital. Hence, they are atomized individuals and cannot use collective actions to protect their legitimate labor rights.
\par
Sales Representatives are trained to act in a specific manner to demonstrate their professional expertise through various types of disciplinary methods.
\par
Company X's new employee training program covered product knowledge, sales skills, role-play practice, among others. The most interesting part of this training was the role-play practice in which a senior MICS or sales manager acted as a doctor and the trainee simulated different scenarios of hospital visits.
\par
With the emphasis on compliance management, Company X encourages all Sales Representatives to improve their accreditations and turn from traditional guanxi-based sales to academic promotion as soon as possible. This has led to a transformation of Sales Representatives into new "professional and valuable individuals".
\par
People will stay in an organization if they think that the structure of the organization conforms to their wishes or can bring them some benefits. However, most people are dissatisfied with the compliance management practices operated at the enterprise level.
\par
The pharmaceutical market in China is reshaping and improving to become a more regulated industry, with the continuous practice of compliance management by TPCs. Doctors have started to accept TPCs' lecture fee in another form and are accepting compliance management.
\par
The generous salary system, good welfare and benefits of transnational companies are also big reasons why sales representatives stay in this industry. In addition to the high salary, TPCs encourage high sales growth.
\par
In the new game of Sales Representatives, doctors, and managers, the Sales Representatives are seemingly more of compromise and consent than fierce resistance. The reasons for compromise are discussed above, and the high salary and generous welfare make them willing to endure all kinds of grievances.
\par
This article shows that compliance management in China is a hybrid product of old and new, a combination of neo-liberal market rationality mixed with old socialist practices.
\par
Burawoy (1979, 1985) showed that the control mechanism of the management over the workers is only one part of the process of the reproduction of management-labor relations. Kellee Tsai (2006) explained that informal institutions are crucial in understanding China's social transformation process.
\par
The national policies compel TPCs to control the sales practices of Sales Representatives through a formalized system called compliance management; however, due to market competition and local factors, TPCs have to make some concessions and disguise noncompliance sales practices.
\par
In the socialist workplace, the new sales model is academic conference promotion, but sometimes middle sales managers and Sales Representatives gang up against the inspection of compliance management by various means.
\par
The changing labor relations in China's pharmaceutical industry are the product of manufacturing consent amid the sales managers, Sales Representatives, doctors, and compliance officers. Chinese Sales Representatives have great autonomy in their jobs, but are still unable to strongly defend their worker rights and interests in the face of capitalist exploitation.
\par
This article discussed compliance management in the socialist workplace from the perspective of workers and management, and revealed that the workplace is in flux and gradually moving towards a neo-liberal business management model.},

  abstract = {The rising number of IoT systems deployed in production increases the risk of becoming a victim of costly attacks. The complex architecture of such systems increases their attack surface making the systems more vulnerable by attacks that can even paralyze production. For 2020, it is estimated that more than 30 billion IoT devices are in use worldwide; of which more than 5.8 billion in the industrial sector. It is therefore imperative today to have a threat modeling tool that examines all system components and assigns them a risk of being exposed. This paper proposes a novel ISO-compliant test procedure for the technical risk analysis of IoT systems since state-of-the-art methods are either not ISO-compliant or are not suitable for technical risk analyses. It is based on the generic threat model Microsoft STRIDE, which has been developed to consider and evaluate all system components. The test procedure is able to identify vulnerabilities and assigns a risk to them. It complies with ISO/IEC 27001 and implies ISO/IEC 27005 and ISO 31000. The threats are stored in a threat database and linked to countermeasures. The designed tool implementing the novel test procedure automatically proposes countermeasures for certain attacks to the user. The tool uses a learning database in which new insights can be entered during each risk analysis so that the tool is improved with each use. As proof of concept, an IoT system is analyzed for its risks and the high achievable accuracy of the proposed risk assessment is shown. \textcopyright{} 2020 IEEE.},

However, improved security performance remains a challenge since individuals often fail to comply with security best practices. In this study, we investigate a new individual cybersecurity compliance behavior model proposed by Donalds and Osei-Bryson (2017). Specifically, we investigate the influence of individual decision styles on their cybersecurity compliance behavior and other antecedents of such behavior. To empirically validate the hypotheses in the Donalds \& Osei-Bryson model, we used data collected from 248 individuals and then use multiple regression to examine the assertions of the model. Our findings confirm that individual's decision styles, specifically, dominant orientation and dominant decision style, influence their individual cybersecurity compliance behavior and other antecedents of such behavior. Our research offers new dimensions for investigating individual cybersecurity compliance behavior and new insights into factors that may influence individual's cybersecurity compliance behavior.},
  note = {wordtune summary
\par
Individual security compliance behavior has been described as the weakest link in the security chain because they often fail to comply with security best practices. Despite increased management efforts to improve security, industry statistics identify individuals' malicious, negligent or inadvertent actions as the top cause of security incidents.
\par
Researchers note that technological solutions are rarely sufficient in protecting critical information system assets, and that organizations should focus on technical as well as non-technical means of protecting their key IS assets.
\par
Scholars and practitioners have proposed many models to explain individual security compliance intention and/or actual behavior. In this study, we have heeded the call to incorporate new theoretical foundations by examining not only extrinsic or perceived factors but also intrinsic factors that may influence an individual's behavior.
\par
To address the gap in the literature on cybersecurity compliance behavior, we introduce and examine the Donalds \& Osei-Bryson (2017) model, which focuses on individuals' decision styles and other antecedents of cybersecurity compliance behavior. We use survey data from 248 individuals to explore the relationships between decision styles and cybersecurity compliance behavior.
\par
Individuals in organizations are required to make decisions daily. Some experts argue that individuals have 'habitual response patterns' in approaching various decision situations in consistent similar ways over time, while others argue that talent, skill, experience and a 'hidden factor' typically influence individuals' decisions.
\par
Decision making style (DMS) is the way an individual visualizes, thinks and interprets situations. DMS can help us understand why individuals make certain security/cybersecurity compliance or non-compliance decisions as well as predict individuals' security/cybersecurity compliance behavior.
\par
Prior research has investigated the relationship between DMS and behavior, and has found that DMS influences decision making behavior, stress and well-being, mental health indicators, and the time required to complete an initial project plan as well as the accuracy of the plan.
\par
The DSI measures four decision making styles: analytical, directive, behavioral and conceptual. Analytical individuals are logical in their approach, have a high tolerance for ambiguity, are slow decision makers, prefer written reports, look for variety in their work and are oriented toward task and technical concerns.
\par
Conceptuals are comfortable with considerable complexity, are interested in people and social concerns, prefer loose control over power, favor openness, share goals with subordinates, are high achievers but crave extrinsic rewards, are creative, value quality, take a system's perspective, and gather information from multiple sources in decision making.
\par
The DSI is used to identify an individual's preferred decision making style. Using this instrument, one can identify the individual's dominant decision making style, back-up decision making style, least preferred decision making style, and very dominant decision making style.
\par
The Donalds \& Osei-Bryson model proposes that decision style theory influences individuals' general cybersecurity compliance behavior and password compliance behavior.
\par
The process used to develop the Donalds \& Osei-Bryson model can be considered to be equivalent to Phase 1 of Kositanurit, Osei-Bryson, and Ngwenyama (2011)'s hybrid process, while the methodology used to evaluate the Donalds \& Osei-Bryson model can be considered to be equivalent to Phase 2.
\par
Our research model is based on the Donalds \& Osei-Bryson model. Some of the hypotheses were generated using decision tree induction and abductive reasoning, and others were presented in prior research.
\par
Dominant orientation is an important trait-based characteristic that influences individuals' security self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is an important construct in cybersecurity/computer security practice as it influences individuals' responses to the challenges of performing security tasks/actions related to established security best practices/policies.
\par
The individual's decision making style is linked to the individual's attitude towards risk, and the individual's attitude towards risk will affect the individual's predisposition and interest concerning practicing security compliance actions.
\par
Dominant decision style influences general security orientation. Individuals with a directive or analytical dominant decision style outperform other individuals with other decision styles in regard to completing an initial project plan using a computerized project management tool as well as the accuracy or completeness of said plan.
\par
General security orientation captures an individual's tendency towards performing security compliance behavior, similar to general health orientation. This study hypothesizes that a similar relationship exists between general security orientation and individual compliance behavior.
\par
General security orientation directly influences general security compliance behavior. It is expected that individuals with higher levels of general security orientation would be more constantly sensitive to the possible occurrence of security incidents and their damaging effects.
\par
According to Hansche (2001), security awareness can be used to heighten the importance of information systems security and to prevent security breaches. Security awareness can also be used to influence individual security compliance behavior.
\par
General security awareness directly influences general security compliance behavior. For example, individuals exposed to security breach news use stronger passwords and change their passwords more frequently.
\par
Self-efficacy is a psychological construct that affects a person's ability to perform a task. It has been shown to influence information security-related behaviors such as information systems policy compliance intention and anti-spyware software use.
\par
Security self-efficacy influences general security compliance behavior. A study showed that self-efficacy influences preventive health care behavior, which suggests that security self-efficacy influences password compliance behavior.
\par
We used a four-step process to investigate the Donalds \& Osei-Bryson model, which involved collecting data, testing the model, and evaluating the model.
\par
The study used the Peircian abduction framework to identify potential predictor and determinant individual cybersecurity compliance behavior variables, and then collected data on cybersecurity and DSI related variables.
\par
Although the 5-point Likert scale has been criticized by some researchers, it has also been successfully applied in various research projects. The 10-point format tended to produce slightly lower relative means.
\par
We collected data from individuals employed in Jamaican companies and faculty members, graduate and some undergraduate students with working experience that are affiliated with an institution of higher learning via a web-based survey.
\par
In this step, we assessed the measurement model for the cybersecurity variables only. We used reliability and validity tests to verify that the observed variables align with the model.
\par
The measurement item reliability was examined for each construct, and all of the measurement item loadings were greater than the minimum recommended value.
\par
The latent variables had adequate reliability scores, as assessed by Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability.
\par
The reliability of the indicators is above the minimum 0.5 threshold value, and the average variance extracted (AVE) of each construct exceeds the minimum cut-off value.
\par
Several statistical remedies have been proposed to address common method variance, but there is no consensus in the literature about how to detect and control for it.
\par
We used multiple linear regression to assess the validity of the causal links specified in the Donalds \& Osei-Bryson model. The binary variable DomOr ('Idea vs. Action') can be directly represented in regression analysis, and the binary decision style variables are indirectly represented by multiple binary numeric dummy variables.
\par
We used SAS Enterprise Miner software to conduct statistical analysis on the Donalds \& Osei-Bryson model, and found that the path from DominantOrientation to SecuritySelf-Efficacy is statistically significant, and that the individual with an Idea orientation has a higher level of SecuritySelf-Efficacy than the individual with an Action orientation.
\par
The results of the regression models indicate that dominant decision style, general security orientation, general security awareness and security self-efficacy are important factors of general security compliance behavior. Security orientation, general security awareness and security self-efficacy exert significant influence on password compliance behavior.
\par
We examined the individual cybersecurity compliance behavior model proposed by Donalds \& Osei-Bryson and found that decision style, dominant (Idea/Action) orientation, and security self-efficacy are important antecedents to cybersecurity compliance behavior. Moreover, general security awareness is a key antecedent to cybersecurity compliance behavior.
\par
In this study, we empirically validated the causal links of a new individual cybersecurity compliance behavior model proposed by Donalds and Osei-Bryson (2017). Our study shows that an individual's dominant decision style exerts significant influence on their general security compliance behavior and security self-efficacy.
\par
Individuals' security compliance behavior has been a challenge for public and private organizations. We propose an explanatory model that includes intrinsic factors as well as extrinsic factors, and that can help organizations adopt appropriate management practices that support the decision styles of individuals in organizations.
\par
The decision-maker could develop training and other appropriate programs to improve the given employeescores for the intrinsic variables (GSAW, SLEF).
\par
The intrinsic variables GSOR, DomDS, and DomOR have direct or indirect impacts on security compliance behavior. However, the decision-maker can determine which employees are assigned to situations that are highly sensitive to individual security compliance behavior.
\par
There are some limitations in this study that create opportunities for further research. For instance, the Donalds \& Osei-Bryson model does not consider the influence of information security policy formulation and effective implementation, information security policy awareness and training, or other relevant antecedents of cybersecurity compliance behavior.
\par
Individual security/cybersecurity compliance behavior remains a challenge for entities. This study examines the influence of decision styles, dominant orientation, general security orientation, general security awareness and security self-efficacy on cybersecurity compliance behavior and offers suggestions regarding management practices that can improve cybersecurity compliance behavior.},

As technologies change, so do the regulations. Original equipment manufacturers and accredited test laboratories must keep up.
\par
The liberalization of the communication industries in three (3) Africa countries of interest has made these countries robust for technology consumption. These countries have put regulations in place to ensure safety of users and seamless processes for products to undergo compliance approval. Globalization has changed the way businesses are approached and processes are administered in achieving corporate objectives, and OEMs are adopting global compliance standards to give their businesses the much-needed edge over their competition. Type approvals or homologation is the key word which is responsible for this phenomenon.
\par
Type approval is the process of ensuring that telecommunications equipment is placed, sold, or used in a new market without causing damage to telecommunications networks, other equipment, or the public.
\par
This research explored the process of equipment compliance type approval in Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya using online secondary data and consulted past journals and conference papers on researches on the three countries.
\par
Research on communication technology equipment type approval in Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya will help OEMs to navigate local barriers and stay above their competition.
\par
Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced a surge in communication equipment market growth. The Nigerian environment requires three levels of market access; the Nigerian Communication Commission, Standard Organization of Nigeria Conformity Assessment Program and the Nigeria Custom Service.
\par
The Nigerian Communication Act 2003 empowers the Commission to make and publish guidelines for the use of communications equipment.
\par
SONCAP verifies shipments of products to be imported into Nigeria in accordance to approved technical regulations. If the product does not meet the required standard, a non-conformity report will be issued.
\par
South Africa is the second largest economy in Africa and has a diversified economy.
\par
ICASA regulates telecommunication, broadcasting and postal industries, and issues compliance approval for electronic communication equipment. SABS certifies electrical components for safety reason, and NRCS administers regulations to protect human health, safety and the environment.
\par
Kenya is the commercial and economic hub of East Africa. The Communication Authority of Kenya (CAK) and Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) regulate market access to Kenya.
\par
Most African countries adopt the European Norms (EN) and R\&TTE (or RED) and CE Declarations of Conformity (DoCs) as proof for compliance, except Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya.
\par
The growth in digital economy has given rise to unprecedented growth of technology-based services in sub-Saharan Africa. OEMs and laboratories must understand the prevailing standards and procedures for market access.
\par
Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa still have technology restrictions on devices with e-band capabilities. Constant interface with country regulatory agencies is necessary.
\par
Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Independent Communications Authority of South Africa, International Organization of Standardization, National Government of South Africa, Rolf Blum, Standard Organization of Nigeria and Conformity Assessment Program are the countries in which wireless and telecom products are regulated.},

\par
This paper provides a novel algorithm for verifying global compliance rules in process choreographies with multiple partners. The algorithm is based on transitivity properties of the underlying GCR specification and can be implemented in first order predicate logic.
\par
The arrival of technologies such as blockchain and Industry 4.0 has pushed the process-oriented collaboration between distributed business partners, realized by so called process choreographies. These choreographies are composed of public models of the partners, and private models that implement and extend the behavior of the public models. A supply chain subject to a Global Compliance Rule (GCR) can be checked using assertions. Assertions are commitments of a partner guaranteeing that its private/public process complies with the constraint. We provide a lossless decomposition algorithm that breaks down a GCR into derived assertions, which can be checked in a distributed way without revealing any private details.
\par
To remain independent of a certain language and technology, we rely on simple rules that consist of antecedent and occurrence patterns. We prove the correctness of the decomposition algorithm and demonstrate its application along basic choreography scenarios.
\par
This section presents definitions and formal backgrounds for global compliance rules over a process choreography. The process choreography includes three types of overlapping models: a private model, a public model, and a choreography model.
\par
We express a GCR based on antecedence and consequence patterns. These patterns are expressed using occurrence and absence nodes, and are interpreted as follows: for each match of an antecedence pattern, there must be at least one match of a consequence pattern. This paper uses the extended compliance rule graph formalism to model the compliance constructs addressed in this paper. It allows for one antecedence occurrence pattern per rule, assumes that rules are structured as trees, and restricts the definition of a GCR to one antecedence occurrence pattern. We translate a GCR into a First Order Logic expression using basic equivalences and show that equivalences are also required for ensuring correctness of the decomposition.
\par
The decomposition algorithm exploits transitivities in GRC to reconstruct the original GCR behavior. The derived assertions reproduce the behavior of the GCR, but not vice versa.
\par
Checking a global compliance rule that refers to interactions and/or public activities can be achieved by applying contemporary compliance checking techniques on the choreography model or the public models of the involved partners.
\par
In scenarios 1 - 3, we assume a simple compliance rule involving two tasks of two different partners. In scenarios 2 and 3, we assume that there is no direct or transitive interaction between partners 1 and 2, and we assume that there are additional message exchanges between partners 1 and 2.
\par
Rightwards transitivity ensures the correctness of scenarios 1 and 3 from Figure 4, and corollary 1 ensures the correctness of scenario 2 from Figure 3.
\par
For partner p1, m1 never executes before p2 and vice versa, so m1 99K A and m1 99K B reproduce the behavior of m1 99K A .
\par
A message exchange m1 between two processors can be reproduced by two assertions, but not the other way around.
\par
The correctness of Scenario 5 concludes from the rightwards transitivity, whereas Scenario 4 relies on the zig zag transitivity of the absence.
\par
The decomposition algorithm walks outwards through all other nodes of the GCR, and copies the visited parts to assertions. Wherever a connector between two nodes is split, the GCR is replicated by using transitive message exchanges between both affected partners.
\par
A message is complemented by a pair of messages, where m1 replaces s in the assertion of (n), m2 replaces n in the assertion of (s), and s never follows m2. To apply Algorithm 1 to GCR C1 from the running example in Fig. 1, assign responsibilities to the partners, then create new assertions for each partner, and transitively replicate the connector where the GCR was split.
\par
The GCR can be decomposed into several decompositions depending on which interactions are used to find a transitive control flow relationship between the nodes of the GCR. If no transitive relations can be identified, sync messages must be exchanged.
\par
This section proves that a GCR can be decomposed into assertions, and shows that the decomposition is lossless. It also shows that multiple sub GCRs can be issued from a single GCR if the partners are not directly connected.
\par
The GCR of a process collaboration is composed of one single inner node. If the node is preceded by two sets of antecedence and consequence occurrence nodes and followed by two other sets of antecedence and consequence occurrence nodes, then the GCR is composed of two composite nodes.
\par
The complexity of the GCR decomposition in Alg. 1 is O(n) for the first and second loops, and O(n) for the third nested inner loop and the last inner loop.
\par
The C3Pro framework was extended with an additional layer dealing with compliance, and it comprises a modeling component for editing and changing process changes, as well as for visualizing change propagations. The framework is provided as a RESTful service, and the Compliance Management Service serves as a pluggable middleware. The decomposition algorithm takes into account the distributed execution of the processes and the different visibility levels of tasks and control flow (privacy). It also takes into account the presence of XOR branches in the processes and ensures correct decomposition even at the presence of XOR branches.
\par
This work is positioned at the interface between process choreographies and process compliance, and discusses existing approaches to process choreography and compliance, including visual notations, logic-based formalisms, and Event Calculus. Several surveys exist, and several approaches address process choreographies and compliance from different perspectives.
\par
We presented an algorithm that decomposes a generic compliance rule (GCR) into derived assertions, which can be checked in a distributed way without violating the privacy of the involved process partners. The algorithm can be extended to GCR with an arbitrary number of antecedence patterns.
\par
A choreography is defined as a set of interactions between partners, a choreography model, and public and private models. It can be checked for structural and behavioral compatibility between public models and consistency between public and private models.
\par
Proof 3 (Chaining Transitivity) says that if A and B occur, then C should occur in between.
\par
Let A;B;M be two activities or interactions, and let A occur before or after B.},

We propose a Barbell strategy-oriented regulatory framework for self-driving vehicles and robots performing collaborative tasks, where regulators and manufacturers/innovators both adopt a Barbell strategy for reaching an optimal solution in regulatory making and compliance management.
\par
Disruptive innovations such as self-driving vehicles and collaborative robots may cause regulatory disruption. During such evolution process, regulatory excellence is paramount for guaranteeing appropriate risk taking, enabling innovators to innovate while efficiently complying to proportionate regulatory frameworks.
\par
Taleb [34] proposed the Barbell strategy for developing anti-fragility, which consists of maximal certainty/low risk on one extreme of the barbell and maximal uncertainty on the other extreme. In this paper, we propose our vision for handling the impact of disruptive technological innovations on regulatory frameworks and compliance management.
\par
Regulators need to adopt a pro-innovation culture and design regulatory processes that mirror the phases of growth of technological innovations. This requires careful, evidence-based decision making, clear policy principles, and flexible problem-solving.
\par
Regulations are laws, formal and informal orders, and rules issued by all levels of government.
\par
Compliance management can be handled in various ways, including automated compliance by design.
\par
Compliance by design is an approach to capture compliance requirements, and facilitate their propagation into process models. It has been implemented in the context of business processes and safety-critical systems engineering.
\par
Argumentation about compliance is an active research topic, and automatic generation of arguments requires stable and broadly accepted reasoning strategies.
\par
Certain technological innovations may undermine existing products, firms, or entire industries, and may cause a regulatory disruption. This disruption can be caused by the innovation falling within an agency's jurisdiction but not square well with the agency's existing regulatory framework. Regulators have various means at disposal to face regulatory disruptions. In the first case, they persist in adopting traditional policy making, while in the second case, they announce via guidance document, warning letter, or press release that they will take action against companies that employ novel technologies or business practices.
\par
Taleb mentions the Barbell-strategy in his book on anti-fragility. The Barbell-strategy consists of a bimodal strategy, a combination of two extremes, one safe and one speculative.
\par
In our vision, regulators, assessors, standardisation bodies and manufacturers cooperate to identify a proportionate regulatory framework and compliance management.
\par
Our vision can shed lights on the current development in the automotive and robotics domains. Road vehicles that still square well with the existing regulatory framework can comply with ISO 26262 and UL4600, while robots that have a disruptive degree of cooperation can comply with ISO 10218-1.
\par
Compliance can be managed via different approaches with different degrees of automation. The Barbell strategy-oriented compliance management vision is depicted in Fig. 4.
\par
A double Barbell strategy for regulatory frameworks and compliance management allows parties to take advantage of the opportunities inherent proven/mature best practices.
\par
The SPI Manifesto targets software, but our vision embraces disruptive innovations in general. We see that our Barbell strategy-oriented vision pursues a bimodal strategy that preserves useful portions of regulatory frameworks and discards what is not applicable anymore, replacing it with risky but temporary and dynamic solutions.
\par
A Barbell strategy is proposed to handle disruptions in regulatory frameworks and compliance management to maintain academic excellence while avoiding psychological diseases that usually accompany Asian students.
\par
We present our intended research roadmap for the SACSys (Safe and Secure Adaptive Collaborative Systems) project. We intend to analyse the ongoing changes within the standards in order to design our barbells and explore the benefits of combining traditional regulatory frameworks with experimental and sunset-based regulatory frameworks.
\par
In this paper, we have presented our Barbell strategy-oriented vision for handling disruptive technological solutions impacting regulatory frameworks and compliance management.},

Security requirements are derived from several fields, including software engineering, information systems risk assessment, security auditing, compliance management, IT governance, etc. A new perspective on eliciting security requirements is proposed based on knowledge-driven integration of approaches from these fields.
\par
Security requirements can be encountered in a variety of situations: business analysts propose requirements for developing software applications, managers analyze requirements to create policies that mitigate risks, executives check requirements regarding the regulatory obligations, auditors evaluate requirements against standards, etc. This paper proposes to integrate requirements based on semantic technology.
\par
Our proposal is motivated by the fact that each GRC discipline alone creates valuable information for the other two and repetitive tasks are done if they are treated separately. To enable their integration, we propose a knowledge repository of requirements that can be shared by stakeholders.
\par
Software engineering stressed the importance of security requirements and recommended goal-driven methodologies for eliciting security requirements. However, existing approaches to integrating security requirements with governance, risk and compliance are not machine readable.
\par
Ontologies have been used in requirements engineering with several applications, but their role in supporting different requirements engineering activities is not clear.
\par
There are multiple paths for eliciting security requirements, including software engineering, reports of risk assessments, guidelines and informal representations in natural language statements.
\par
To transform natural language requirements into RDF knowledge graphs, we need to use a manual approach and a semi-automated approach. We can also reuse some of the already available knowledge expressed in other repositories or include some universally valid information.
\par
The work at hand proposes to add semantics to diagrammatic forms used in describing security requirements by resorting to the knowledge conversion framework proposed by .
\par
An internet banking system is modeled as a UML use case model, with a series of financial operations and two possible abuse cases for a hacker. The model is exported as RDF knowledge graphs.
\par
We can use models to describe the security requirements for certain business assets. For example, a model can be created to represent the security requirements for online authentication and can be enriched with threat cases like stolen password.
\par
Our paper proposes an approach for eliciting security requirements that is based on the integration of multiple sources for requirements, unified in terms of representation with the help of RDF. This approach will enable a shared, explicit and formal analysis of requirements.},

In recent years, numerous compliance challenges have been reported on in literature. This paper aims to provide clarity on the types of challenges faced by commercial organizations and explore the pros and cons of a holistic approach to compliance.
\par
This paper starts off by reviewing the challenges faced by commercial organizations in trying to achieve and maintain legal and regulatory compliance. It then codes, clusters and categorizes the challenges under two broad headings: external issues that result from developments in the external environment and internal issues that result from organizational setup.
\par
Nine clusters of compliance challenges could be identified from the review of academic publications. Additional source materials were gathered and processed to support the existing clusters.
\par
This paper discusses the challenges faced by commercial organizations and proposes a holistic approach to managing compliance. It also compares guidance materials issued by governments and regulators on the design and implementation of internal compliance programmes.
\par
Contemporary organizations face many compliance challenges, such as technological innovation, stakeholder expectations, growing pressure from global movements and watchdogs, changes in employer-employee relationships and a legal and regulatory landscape that is constantly evolving and expanding.
\par
Modern tools for managing compliance, like machine learning, big data analytics, artificial intelligence and other improvements in automated analysis and computer thinking, bring both opportunities and risks, especially in the field of security, privacy and compliance.
\par
In today's economy, many workers are engaged in alternative employment arrangements, which pose significant challenges for compliance professionals. These challenges include dealing with large numbers of independent contractors, temporary employees, outsourced activities, interns, externs, and other atypical forms of labour relationships.
\par
Compliance challenges result from an ever-evolving legal and regulatory landscape, which is characterized by inconsistencies, conflicting requirements and a range of interpretation- and implementation problems. In extreme cases, new laws and regulations may transform entire industries or call existing strategies and business models into question.
\par
Companies often struggle to define a strategy to manage legal and regulatory compliance risks. These strategies are often ad hoc and not sustainable, and companies lack the ability to focus on those areas that present the highest likelihood of non-compliance.
\par
There are several problems associated with implementing a compliance programme, including problems with international standards and norms clashing with local norms, problems with managing third parties, and problems with developing and attracting staff that are skilled enough to mitigate compliance risks.
\par
A holistic compliance management strategy is an approach that aims for coherent instead of fragmented compliance efforts, a long-term scope and the ability to cover multiple laws, standards frameworks or internal procedures simultaneously.
\par
A holistic approach to legal and regulatory compliance management promotes sharing structures, resources, methodologies and best practices across all compliance areas and across business functions, and recognizes the need for developing meaningful values and ethics which resonate and are relevant for all compliance areas.
\par
The alternative means of managing compliance are being linked to various benefits, including better understanding and prioritisation of risk across the business, and enhanced understanding of the reasons for compliance failures.
\par
A holistic approach to compliance can help eliminate unnecessary duplication of efforts in setting up internal reporting systems, third-party due diligence frameworks, awareness and training programmes, internal communication channels, monitoring procedures, etc. It can also help avoid negative effects that may emerge from having too few or too many controls.
\par
A holistic approach to compliance is an approach that promotes coherent efforts across multiple compliance areas, cross-functional collaboration and coordination across risk and control departments and the business at large, and establishes an overarching ethical culture. It is believed to result in increased effectiveness of compliance efforts.
\par
Several countries have issued guidance on how to implement an effective compliance programme, and this guidance can be seen in the OECD Good Practice Guidance on Internal Controls, Ethics and Compliance, the UK Bribery Act and the French Anti-Corruption Agency Guidelines.
\par
Similar core elements are referred to in official guidelines relevant to other compliance domains. A company's tailor-made internal compliance programme should include top-level management commitment to compliance, an effective organizational structure, training and awareness raising, proper processes and procedures, proper recordkeeping, documentation and reporting, and regular performance reviews and audits.
\par
Cross-functional collaboration between departments can provide significant benefits, according to a recent survey of compliance leaders conducted by Baker McKenzie across 537 multinational companies with a UK turnover of \textsterling 1 billion or more. This is because most measures and controls to mitigate employee crime and misconduct are situational measures.
\par
A proper level of internal control requires both formal and informal control mechanisms. Often referred to as "soft controls", these more informal measures and controls focus on the organizational culture, behaviour of management and employees, and on achieving organizational objectives.
\par
Financial services firms are moving away from a separate culture and conduct risk area and are focusing on holistic compliance. This is because attempting to tackle every type of misconduct with a formal control may prove impossible and may even yield unwanted side-effects.
\par
A move towards a holistic approach to compliance has the potential to increase effectiveness and boost efficiencies, but it is important to avoid losing expertise by looking for efficiencies in non-expert areas while keeping experts in place for ad hoc advice and investigative support.
\par
A second limitation of a holistic approach to environmental crime prevention is that preventive measures must be tailored to the risk or issue that they aim to address. This requirement to be 'crime-specific' is one of the seminal and perhaps most important themes in situational crime prevention.
\par
Integrating compliance programmes requires buy-in from regulators. If they insist on separate programmes, there is little room for integration.
\par
In today's rapidly changing environment, companies face a plethora of challenges while trying to mitigate legal and regulatory risks. These challenges require a decisive and coherent response.
\par
Some propose to move towards a holistic compliance management strategy, which takes a pro-active, long-term view and promotes coherent rather than fragmented efforts across multiple compliance areas. This approach will increase the overall effectiveness of compliance efforts, boost efficiencies and reduce the overall cost of compliance.
\par
The suggested move towards a more holistic, values-based approach to compliance is supported by increasing convergence in guidance provided by governments and regulators on the design and implementation of internal compliance programmes, and by recent developments in the enforcement strategy and tactics of prosecutors and investigative agencies.
\par
Searches were conducted in Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar for publications dealing with compliance challenges faced by commercial organizations in 2017, 2018 or 2019.},

\par
Australian corporate law allows for significant civil penalties to be imposed by a court on negligent corporate officers, including directors. This article explores the various criticisms of stepping-stones and proposes a legislative alternative that rebalances individual officer liability.
\par
ASIC has used the 2020 decision in Cassimatis v Australian Securities and Investments Commission to prosecute regulatory failures.
\par
The Cassimatis litigation shows that the stepping-stones strategy is used in connection with disclosure failures.
\par
A regulator's strategy for improving corporate compliance might be to guide and deter individuals to approach compliance-related issues with greater care, skill and diligence.
\par
Courts have excluded decisions about design and resourcing of the corporate compliance function from the business judgment safe harbour, and there is no clearly articulated collective board duty of oversight.
\par
Control failures and contraventions arising from the corporation carrying out its activities without due regard for the legal consequences of its decision or action.
\par
The stepping-stones strategy is an attempt to balance the public interest in improving corporate compliance with the development of workable governance arrangements.
\par
The discussion is organised as follows: Part I introduces the argument, Part II explains how s 180(1) of the Corporations Act is applied, Part III analyses the criticisms of stepping-stones actions and Part IV suggests a legislative alternative.
\par
The current debate over officers' liability generally is informed by the broader economic, political and societal context, and by the perception that wealthy individuals enjoy the upside of corporate risk-taking but fail to take appropriate responsibility.
\par
The BFRC did not recommend changes to the directors' duty of care. The Treasury may postpone or jettison measures to expand legal liability for individual corporate officers as part of a broader deregulatory agenda.
\par
An officer of a corporation is liable for negligence if the person makes or participates in making decisions that affect the whole or a substantial part of the business of the corporation.
\par
A subsidiary's senior manager is unlikely to exert the kind of individual influence over other group entities to bring that person within the definition of an officer.
\par
A director of a corporation can be held liable for contravening a Commonwealth law.
\par
ASIC's proceedings against the chairman and chief executive of a listed entity arose out of allegedly misleading and deceptive market announcements.
\par
A court can find that a company's directors contravened their duty of care by exposing the company to criminal prosecution, civil liability or significant reputational damage.
\par
The measure of an officer's conduct is what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances to respond to a foreseeable risk. The court will consider the magnitude of the risk, the probability of it occurring, the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating action, and any other conflicting responsibilities.
\par
The business judgment rule applies to transactions that unfold otherwise than expected, and the Shirt calculus applies when the risk involved is a compliance risk.
\par
The business judgment rule only applies when an officer 'makes a business judgment'. Failures that result in compliance breaches are generally not considered to involve business judgments.
\par
Australian courts do not defer to commercial judgment in relation to compliance risk management, and commercial judgments about whether particular information about an entity is information that a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of its securities are not treated as business judgments.
\par
Contraventions that flow from a business failure must be distinguished from compliance failures that result from either a failure of the corporation's compliance systems or a disregard for the potential legal and regulatory consequences of a business decision.
\par
The law of negligence requires decision-makers to balance risk and benefit in making resource allocation decisions in conditions of uncertainty. In doing so, they must balance the risk of catastrophic injury to people who come onto their land with the risk of regulatory contraventions.
\par
Where there is a risk of civil penalties or other liability to the company, it may be a breach of duty for a director to embark on or authorise a course of action that attracts the risk.
\par
The reference to "at least" includes obvious cases of contravention, but excludes cases where no reasonable person holding the director's position would have known.
\par
The stepping-stones cases lie somewhere in the middle of the commercial ocean between corporate conduct that will obviously contravene the law and individual conduct that no reasonable person in the defendant's position could have foreseen would cause the corporation to contravene the law.
\par
The balancing exercise extends beyond monetary considerations to consider the continued existence of the corporation and its interest in pursuing lawful activity.
\par
In a case of negligence, the focus must be on whether the officer's response to the foreseeable risk was reasonable. The officer's response must be reasonable in light of all the competing calls on their resources.
\par
In the stepping-stones cases, the distinction between corporate compliance failures that arise from business plans not coming to fruition may be relevant.
\par
Mariner's countervailing benefits well exceeded the theoretical risks.
\par
Storm, a financial advice firm, breached the Corporations Act by providing unlicensed services.
\par
In years before the GFC, Storm was accepted by the court to have contravened the financial services laws by recommending the Storm model to a wider class of clients than it should have.
\par
At first instance, Edelman J held that the defendants did not take sufficient steps to prevent inappropriate advice from being given to 11 vulnerable investors. On appeal, Greenwood J held that the defendants could have taken steps to prevent the inappropriate advice from being given.
\par
In cases where the corporate compliance failure is due to a business judgment that turned out otherwise than planned, the balancing exercise is easier.
\par
This part analyses five criticisms of stepping-stones made by Rares J in his dissenting judgment in the Cassimatis Appeal, and broader concerns about the strategy and its potential impact on director behaviour.
\par
Rares J concluded that ASIC's case used s 180(1) of the Corporations Act in an arcane and backdoor fashion, and that ASIC was unwilling to prove that it would have taken enforcement action if it had discovered the breach.
\par
The risk an officer must guard against is detection and enforcement, and not the risk of the corporation's internal systems making the breach undetectable or the regulators asleep at the wheel.
\par
Rares J did not believe that ASIC had established that the provision of inappropriate advice would have catastrophic consequences.
\par
Rares J concluded that the strategy was a backdoor way of creating liability on Mr and Mrs Cassimatis as accessories to Storm's substantive contraventions. Greenwood J and Thawley J disagreed.
\par
The court held that s 180(1) of the Corporations Act imposed separate and freestanding liability on officers whose negligent acts or omissions implicated them in corporate compliance failures. It also held that the statute did not impose accessorial liability.
\par
Rares J considered that it was unlikely that the Parliament intended s 180(1) of the Corporations Act to displace, modify or affect a specific statutory duty or power.
\par
ASIC's case used an arcane and backdoor argument to establish its case, instead of proving directly that Mr and Mrs Cassimatis had breached a duty.
\par
Greenwood J dismissed as misconceived criticisms that stepping-stones gives rise to "some sort of dystopian accessorial liability" and disregards the fact that ASIC rarely seeks compensation for the company in these cases.
\par
Stepping-stones liability is attributed to directors when the company has contravened the law or is likely to contravene the law, and the regulator asks the court to consider whether the breach can be attributed to a negligent act or failure by the board.
\par
Stepping-stones cases create increased exposure to penalties for a particular class of individuals only, and the test for individual liability in connection with a breach of the law by a corporation differs depending on the office held.
\par
The court held that the stepping-stones cases are a form of accessorial liability, and that the state has not determined that officers should also be accountable for a breach of a law caused by negligence short of the requirements of accessorial or fiduciary liability.
\par
Stepping-stones is an end-run around the Corporations Act and the defences provided to directors for contraventions. The public interest objectives concerning s 180 of the Corporations Act need to be reconsidered.
\par
ASIC's selection of cases and disposition of those cases is contributing to a widening expectation gap over what individual officers can do to ensure corporate compliance.
\par
The question of what boards are expected to do is an 'elephant in the room' issue. Discussions about the responsibilities of board members rarely touch on what is realistically feasible for them to achieve.
\par
The Westpac Review panel asked what the proper role of the board is in AML/CTF compliance. Corporate lawyers typically advise boards to have oversight over management's risk and compliance.
\par
Stepping-stones provide little guidance for directors and officers in general, as each decision is highly fact-dependant and idiosyncratic.
\par
The stepping-stones cases are of little precedent value, and the statutory norm is inchoate. The duties contained in pt 2D.1 of the Corporations Act, including s 180, derive their content from their general law analogues but have a fundamentally different character.
\par
When a corporation has behaved in a way that attracts significant public opprobrium, ASIC may choose to pursue an action against one or more corporate officers.
\par
Rares J's dissenting judgment in the Cassimatis Appeal draws attention to the way in which ASIC and the Federal Court address the two constituent parts of negligence.
\par
The question is whether it was reasonably foreseeable that the business would be destroyed by not complying with the law.
\par
The directors were negligent in failing to prevent Storm from contravening the financial services law, but the duty was not triggered by the risk of ASIC taking action.
\par
The Shirt calculus is applied to determine what precautions a reasonable person would have taken to avoid harm.
\par
The Ipp Review identified the danger that courts may conflate the concepts of foreseeability and probability, and conclude that a reasonable person would have taken precautions against a risk if it was foreseeable.
\par
The courts and regulators are increasingly falling into a trap of using a corporation's alleged contravention of the law to conclude that it was negligent to not take measures to avert the risk.
\par
If a corporate officer breaches a duty of care, significant penalties can be ordered, along with disqualification from holding corporate office.
\par
The Corporations Act provides that ASIC may hold individual officers liable for corporate compliance breaches where the statutory requirement does not provide for accessorial liability.
\par
The law does not extend to wealth-destroying business ventures, probably because the broader public interest in corporations being law-abiding arises.
\par
In Part III, we explored the reasons why the enforcement strategy for corporate officers is problematic, and in Part IV, we propose an alternative that provides a more comprehensive response to the problems identified in Part III.
\par
An officer would continue to face civil penalty liability for contravening many civil penalty provisions, but without a standalone basis.
\par
ASIC's other enforcement rights and the corporation's private enforcement rights would not be affected by the proposed change.
\par
The proposed amendment to s 344(1) requires a corporation to take reasonable steps to secure compliance with a relevant Commonwealth law, if the harm to the corporation was reasonably foreseeable by the officer at the time of the alleged contravention.
\par
The corporate breach must be proved to the relevant standard, and ASIC may institute proceedings for a breach. The corporation may retain its private rights to enforce the duty of care against the officer.
\par
Australian corporate law has struggled to articulate the proper basis for exposing directors and other corporate officers to civil penalties for their corporation's compliance failures.
\par
The current Corporations Act limits the effectiveness of stepping-stones as a principle to guide board behaviour ex ante. Modest law reform is needed to address these issues.},

In particular, the formal language used in the CMF is able to expressively represent the specifications of normative requirements (hereafter, norms) that impose constraints on various activities of a business process. However, if the language used lacks expressiveness and the modelling constructs proposed in the CMF are not able to properly represent different types of norms, it can significantly impede the reliability of the compliance results produced by the CMF.

\par
The Compliance management maturity model (CMMM) is one measurement method for assessing the degree of Compliance Management implementation. The existing CMMM cannot cover all the current CMMM requirements from the ISO 37301 international standard.
\par
In a complex business environment, regulators and decision-makers are forced to update laws, standards, and policies, and organizations are forced to update their business process to comply with the requirements. However, compliance management has formed silos in many organizations, wasting scarce management attention.
\par
The current maturity model is heavily oriented in the disciplines of software development and software engineering. However, due to the impact of information technology on project management, the current maturity model can also be used to measure the effectiveness of compliance management systems.
\par
Compliance is the act of altering one's conduct in response to another person's explicit or implicit request. It is sometimes referred to as an exterior form of social influence.
\par
Compliance is a continuous process that occurs when a business fulfills its commitments. It is made durable by integrating it into the culture of the organization and the conduct and attitude of its employees.
\par
Using core values and commonly acknowledged good governance, ethical, and community norms, organizations can shape their approach to compliance. This requires leadership at all levels, as well as acknowledging and implementing strategies to encourage compliant behavior.
\par
A compliance management maturity model (CMMM) is a forward-looking approach that measures the conformity to the standards and the capabilities and capacities of the organization to support the effectiveness of management system implementation.
\par
There are challenges in adapting maturity models to compliance, such as defining a final maturity state and defining factors and characteristics measured to support findings regarding compliance.
\par
The maturity level of a compliance management system can be determined by a reference like the ISO 37301 standard, which lays out standards as well as guidelines for compliance management systems and best practices.
\par
This study focuses on the CMMM framework, the critical parts of the model, the number of maturity levels, the lowest maturity level, and the maximum maturity level. It also considers the CMMM's implementation and use in enterprises.
\par
This research uses ISO 37301 clauses as a proxy benchmark for comparative review of how the implementation of the Compliance Management in today's organizations compares with the existing CMMMs.
\par
This paper uses CMMM models from Jackman (2015), Otte (2018), RSA (2020), Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics (2018), and OCEG (2016) to analyze the gap between the models and ISO 37301.
\par
The table shows that all current maturity levels consist of 5 levels, and that ISO 37301 Compliance Management International Standards are a proxy for compliance management system implementation requirements in today's organizations.
\par
Current observed CMMM do not address opportunities in their measurements. In the high uncertainties' era, organizations not only built their resilience, but they also needed to build their agility.
\par
All observed CMMM do not mention the investigation process in their measurement. However, the ISO 37301 states that an organization shall develop, establish, implement and maintain processes to assess, evaluate, investigate and close reports on suspected or actual instances of non-compliance.
\par
This paper reviews the similarities and differences among the compliance management maturity models and suggests that the current edition of CMMM takes into account technological innovation and the possibility for new context changes and risks.
\par
This research has its practical implications. The complexity and rapid change in today's environment make some CMMM unsuitable for today's organization, and the compliance practitioners have to regularly reassess the firm's maturity level and capability in practicing compliance management.

At the same time, private, de-centralised rights enforcement is becoming more prominent, at least as measured by the amount of preliminary references submitted to the CJEU. The Commission actively supports this trend, and in effect outsources its own enforcement work to private actors, both individual and collective. The article outlines Commission efforts to facilitate private enforcement and discusses whether private enforcement can substitute for centralised enforcement. It concludes that all channels of rights enforcement have a role to play, and the loss of any single channel cannot easily be compensated.},

  abstract = {We trace the pragmatic turn in regulatory governance from the level of the state and civil society to the coalface of the regulated organization. Since the 1980s, an array of new regulatory models has emerged. These models, while distinct, are unified in two related tendencies. First, they support the devolution of responsibility for standard setting, program design, and enforcement to the regulated organization. This delegation of governance to the organization itself has catalyzed the creation of accountability infrastructures within organizations, a network of offices, roles, programs, and procedures dedicated to aligning the organization's operations with external standards, codes of conduct, ethical and normative expectations, and regulations. Second, the diverse regulatory models depend, often implicitly, on organizational accountability infrastructures that incorporate the tenets of pragmatist philosophy: inquiry through narration, adaptation to context, and problem-solving through experimentation. Reviewing the empirical literature on organizational compliance, we find ample evidence of inquiry through narration at the organizational coalface. However, we find limited evidence of narrating plurality in the organization and narrating experimentation as problem-solving, as these activities create tensions with internal and external parties who expect singular, stable representations of governance. These tensions reveal an important incongruity between pragmatic governance across organizations and pragmatic governance within organizations. We contribute to the regulatory governance literature by documenting this important shift in the locus of governance to the organizational coalface and by charting a new research agenda. We argue that examinations of regulatory governance should be retraced in three ways. First, attention should shift to the organizational coalface, recognizing and analyzing accountability infrastructures as the central contemporary mechanism of governance. Second, the long-standing focus in regulatory studies on why parties comply should shift to understanding how regulated parties manage themselves to achieve compliance. Third, analyses of compliance should examine the tensions in narrating adaptation and experimentation, and the implications of such tensions for the achievement of prosocial outcomes.},

\par
We trace the pragmatic turn in regulatory governance from the level of the state and civil society to the coalface of the regulated organization. We argue that the focus of regulatory studies should shift from understanding why parties comply to understanding how regulated parties manage themselves to achieve compliance.
\par
There are many different types of regulation, including performance-based regulation, light-touch regulation, right-touch regulation, responsive regulation, risk-based regulation, intermediary-managed regulation, experimentalist regulation, and so on.
\par
Regulatory prescriptions vary in their approaches to compliance, but they all promote the idea that regulated parties should self-regulate, design systems to achieve externally mandated standards, and provide an account to external standard-setters of how they produce compliance.
\par
Contemporary regulatory models reflect central themes of philosophical pragmatism, which recognizes that rules, models, and conceptions of compliance get reshaped in the process of implementation. These processes are social transactions engaged on the basis of a "deep bed of human practices."
\par
Scholars have focused on the role of regulatory models in society, but have not adequately studied accountability infrastructures, which are the array of roles, offices, programs, and processes dedicated to aligning an organization's operations with external standards.
\par
Organizations must devote increasing attention and resources to managing myriad self-regulation processes to comply with externally generated performance norms, which are increasingly complex and requiring home-grown responses or adapting off-the-shelf systems to be locally meaningful and workable.
\par
A review of empirical studies in the distinct scholarly fields of regulation and organization studies suggests that accountability infrastructures are a pragmatic enterprise that depend on narration, adaptation to context, and problem-solving through experimentation. This is difficult to achieve because of the incongruity between pragmatic regulatory governance across organizations and pragmatic regulatory governance within organizations.
\par
We argue that regulatory action has moved from the realm of governance actors such as states, non-governmental organizations, and other external standard-setters to the realm of regulated parties themselves, and that future studies of regulatory compliance should focus on the accountability infrastructures built within organizations to align routines with external demands.
\par
In the next section, we introduce the concept of accountability infrastructures, and show how they are enacted in contemporary organizations. We discuss the implications of "pragmatist turtles all the way down" in the concluding and final sections.
\par
Accountability infrastructures are an increasingly ubiquitous array of organizational roles, offices, programs, and processes dedicated to aligning the organization's operations with external standards, codes of conduct, ethical and normative expectations, and legal regulations. These processes vary greatly in their intentionality and self-consciousness.
\par
Companies are becoming more accountable to regulations, standards, codes, and ethical expectations. Dedicated accountability offices and roles oversee the organization's commitment to diversity, the environment, health and safety, codes of conduct, technical standards, risk management, accessibility, corporate social responsibility, privacy, and so on.
\par
Compliance is the goal of organizational programs, trainings, implementation procedures, guidelines, corrective actions, communications, data management tools, audits, and reporting structures. The gap between actions and expectations should be expected and continuously governed to achieve close to compliance rather than compliance.
\par
Techno-legal experts engage in considerable interpretative work related to external performance expectations and explore appropriate means of achieving such expectations. This work is continuously shaped by interactions among techno-legal representatives of organizations, intermediaries, and external standard-setters.
\par
Management systems are used to show how compliance or performance is achieved. They include policies, operating procedures, and guidelines, as well as training, handbooks, forms, checklists, and audits.
\par
Management systems incorporate the "plan-do-check-act" process into all aspects of compliance, and are inspired by the quality movement of the mid-twentieth century. These systems are supported by an ideology of continuous improvement through analysis of and learning from the past.
\par
Management systems transform external expectations into policies, standard operating procedures, and guidelines, and support accountability staff by providing a means of integrating external requirements into the operation of the organization and systematically managing them. These systems can be supported by digital systems that house electronic traces of action.
\par
Accountability infrastructures bridge external expectations with compliant performances. They prevent meaningful enactment of accountability infrastructures because of power and resources, mimetic one-size-fits-all design forces, and singular, centralized designs focused on minimizing variation.
\par
While senior managers and accountability professions have an important role in setting the direction and providing resources, most accountability systems distribute the daily work of producing compliance to employees throughout the organization. However, employees may not have the knowledge, authority, or time to fulfill this responsibility.
\par
Hierarchy, power, authority and expertise within the organization, and conflicting individual/group interests can insulate senior managers from compliance issues at the coalface. Self-regulatory paradigms may just push regulatory burdens deep within the organization.
\par
Regulatory governance models require that external auditors have operational knowledge and experience relevant to effectively evaluate the local system meant to produce compliance. This requires that external auditors have a wider set of capabilities than regulators do.
\par
While accountability infrastructures are ideally adapted to local contexts, there are many off-the-shelf packages that integrate and generalize so-called best practices. Regulatory intermediaries help firms adopt and implement external standards.
\par
Accountability infrastructures allow organizations to monitor and assess compliance indicators over time and organization spaces, but singular, centralized accountability infrastructures reflect and perpetuate the understanding of organizations as monolithic actors.
\par
Accountability infrastructures need to be mobilized, eventually routinized, and substantively and practically enacting the organization's reference narrative. This requires habitual self-observation, reporting, reflection, and responsiveness.
\par
Accountability infrastructures can be designed to increase compliance by mobilizing and coordinating actions that improve compliance at the organizational ground-level. This is done by integrating the central concepts of pragmatist philosophy into accountability infrastructures to produce new and sustainable habits.
\par
Pragmatism is distinguished from other philosophies of knowledge (and politics) by its distinctive theory of truth. It argues that the true is whatever proves itself to be good for particular persons in specific contexts, struggling with diverse problems, needs, and satisfactions.
\par
Pragmatists insist that the primacy of inquiry and experimentation to social action, human agency, and creativity derived from incessant and relentless problem-solving - trial and error - within the contexts of action, is derived from the embrace of variation across diverse actors and settings.
\par
Recent empirical studies of regulatory compliance within organizations show that organizations can transform regulatory requirements into routinized habits.
\par
Conversation is the fundamental material of human relations, and it is used to identify and name the connections among organizational processes and regulatory expectations. It is a form of inquiry that develops, carries, and conveys knowledge.
\par
Talk is a form of inquiry that connects one's intentions to the expectations of an audience, offers an excuse for unanticipated behavior, and can be used to accomplish power and dominate.
\par
Conversations can build and distribute cultural, human, and social capital through advice, sharing job references, showing resistance to authority, or mobilizing for legal change. Ordinary conversations can also sustain the taken-for-granted world by eliding those very connections between particular actions and general patterns.
\par
Narrating accountability among organizational members helps construct responses to regulatory expectations and challenges, and helps managers make decisions that achieve compliance goals. Such stories are made visible and reviewed by legal counsel, and decisions are held accountable.
\par
We first recognized the role of narration in meeting safety requirements when we observed environmental, health, and safety staff in a research university. The EHS staff felt isolated and unsure of their roles and how to do the job successfully.
\par
The EHS coordinators shared information about safety as well as hints for dealing with difficult and often recalcitrant researchers. They also learned from each other about the institutional and material infrastructure of the university.
\par
When managers adopt a commitment rather than compliance approach, labor conditions and production improve and become more compliant with international labor standards. However, most commitment practices target workers on the shop floor, and may not sufficiently address the "root causes" of many labor violations.
\par
Sousa et al. (2010) report that resilient compliance is achieved by constant negotiation of the terms and directions of work, molding and legitimizing the diverse performances and the collective representation. This enhanced "group performance" and produced an "eye-opener" of what needed to be done.
\par
The profusion of regulations may demand active narration by employees to achieve regulatory goals while nonetheless breaking rules. In these circumstances, narrative processes can be mobilized to promote compliance while developing accurate accounts of how work gets done, or to co-opt subordinate actors to work against the regulatory goal.
\par
Even the world of finance, which is "oblivious to legal and ethical obligation," can be transformed by telling different kinds of stories. These stories can provide warning and instruction, and can also offer redemption narratives.
\par
Compliance narratives may be required or offered voluntarily and may be offered to internal or external audiences. Required internal narratives may help increase compliance, while voluntary internal narratives may be offered for information sharing, undertaken for organizational learning purposes, or perhaps performed as conversational strategies to display competitive achievement and enhance status.
\par
Narratives of performance outcomes can be in the form of checklists, training materials, extensive written reports and statistical analyses. They can also focus on ongoing processes, outcomes achieved, or weave some complex combination of continuous action and outcomes.
\par
Financial and performance reporting through quantified indicators is a special case of an accountability infrastructure, while other accountability infrastructures such as ethics, health and safety, environmental protection, human resources, and patient protection are often treated as peripheral to organizational operations.
\par
The investigation reports written following major accidents or technological failures often fail to repair the organizational and regulatory failures or to improve practices because they normally aggregate and abstract the partial knowledge of the many participants rather than rework organizational routines.
\par
The holistic "narrative" is revised and fine-tuned by lawyers, safety experts, and technical advisors so that the viewpoints of multiple stakeholders are literally written into the regulatory process. This knowledge is ex-post-facto and may offer limited instruction for decision-making in the immediate context of action.
\par
The forms of narration, the social statuses of narrators and audiences, and the authority and legitimacy of different accounts affect how regulatory compliance is performed within the organization and how it is appraised by external regulators and reviewers.
\par
Narration and storytelling alone do not enhance compliance, but they are the means of discovering together what needs to be done. To fashion reasonable and pragmatic organizational responses to regulations, relevant actors need to ask themselves "What is go
\par
Narration alone does not enhance compliance, and does not make compliance pragmatic. Organizational actors need to recognize contextual variation and accommodate it.
\par
Pragmatism recognizes that variations across phenomena, situations, and contexts are inevitable, and that ideas, actions, and choices should be assessed in relation to the particular features of the situation.
\par
Several extant models of regulatory governance recognize that responses should vary according to the situation, but variation within organizations is commonly interpreted as failure or deviance. Neo-institutional organizational scholars have encouraged such interpretations, labeling the observed organizational variations as institutional decoupling.
\par
Accountability infrastructures are centralized and singular structures that identify variation in conditions and responses within organizations as problematic. They offer common tools to reduce and eliminate variation in performance outcomes.
\par
The external regulatory model encourages variation in responses across organizations in relation to their operating context, while internal accountability infrastructures discourage variation in responses within organizations in relation to local operating conditions and cultures. Taking variation in conditions seriously demands accommodations in what action is necessary to generate compliance.
\par
Studies suggest that organizations should give units or groups some freedom to develop their own responses to external demands. This may be reflected in the different strategies and techniques used to achieve compliance, which may vary depending on the local work, resources, culture, and history.
\par
The pragmatic orientation acknowledges that policies are experiments, and that solutions are expected to vary across contexts. It also acknowledges that multiple means to any given end are expected.
\par
The experimentalist approach to governance embraces multiple routes to the same goal, usually vaguely specified, and encourages self-reflection and narration by fostering deliberation among stakeholders. It is especially recommended for harmonizing across transnational coordination.
\par
The paradigm acknowledges reality on the ground, and expects regular performance reporting, peer review, and corrective action. It also expects periodic revision of goals, metrics, and decision-making procedures.
\par
We find limited evidence of compliance experiments, in which organizations self-consciously appraise different routes to improved compliance through designed alterations in policies and practices. Moreover, we suggest that local experimentation is at odds with centralized, best practices focused on core operations.
\par
The scarcity of experimentalist approaches within organizational accountability infrastructures may be a sign that the pragmatist perspective has not filtered down from regulatory governance models to the organizational coalface.
\par
Contemporary models of regulatory governance promote pragmatism, adapting to context and problem-solving through experimentation. Organizations develop accountability infrastructures to respond to external standards.
\par
We describe how organizations align their operations with external expectations through a network of offices, roles, programs, and procedures. These systems support the development of internal and external accounts of how compliance is achieved.
\par
We find ample evidence of inquiry through narration at the organizational ground-level, but limited evidence of narrating plurality in the organization and almost no evidence of narrating experimentation as problem-solving. We suspect that pragmatist tendencies that inform contemporary regulatory policy models need to be incorporated within accountability infrastructures.
\par
Scholarship documenting inquiry through narration, accommodation of variation, and experimentation work at the organizational level suggests mechanisms for mobilizing accountability infrastructures for better regulatory compliance. These mechanisms can be embedded within familiar habits to maintain reliable compliance across complex and distributed production systems.
\par
The design of accountability infrastructures is studied at the organizational and cross-organizational levels. It is hoped that as these infrastructures are studied across various organizations, they will be specifically recognized as instances of accountability infrastructures.
\par
Many questions raised at the organization level should be addressed through cross-organizational studies, such as examining how the design of these structures varies across organizations and what variables account for these differences.
\par
Beyond understanding the constitution of accountability infrastructures, studies of how regulated parties manage themselves to achieve compliance are needed.
\par
Because regulatory responsibility has been broadly diffused, weak or failed compliance is often the result of organizational systems that are not functioning as needed. Research is needed to understand how power differentials, access to resources, and distributions of expertise shape the enactment of infrastructures.
\par
By urging attention to how accountability infrastructures work, we suggest that studies of enactment should also focus on account-giving and narration, internally and externally, and how these narratives differ from prior compliance narratives identified in the literature.
\par
Research on accountability infrastructures should examine how narrative, accommodation of variation, and experimentation function at the organizational or cross-organizational level, and how organizations reflect on and embed knowledge produced by experiments in the design and enactment of accountability infrastructures.
\par
Strong cultural forces impede the pragmatic adaptation to the universal observation of inevitable variation in performance. This is because conventional ethical and legal discourses concerning fairness, equality, and meritocracy impede the acceptance of different criteria for acceptable performance.
\par
The relationship between organizations and external parties (regulators, auditors, accreditors, and other evaluators) requires consideration at both the organizational and cross-organizational level. This relationship is informed by accountability infrastructures.
\par
Contemporary regulatory models are less reductionist, less partial, less mechanistic, and less idealistic than the earlier mid-20th-century models. They require organizations to self-regulate in accordance with a multitude of external regulations, standards, and norms.},

Ontology-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to support compliance management with critical software system engineering standards. The approach is demonstrated by processing ECSS-E-ST-40C, a space software engineering standard, and generating models and mappings, as well as reverse compliance management of extended process model.
\par
Compliance with relevant regulations is a mandatory requirement for getting the approval or acceptance from the certification body. However, the process compliance is perceived as a complex and labour-intensive task due to the manual effort required for extracting, modelling, and managing traceability.
\par
Several studies have been conducted on process extraction from textual descriptions and generation of OMG's Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) models. This paper builds on our previous work and uses ontology-based NLP for compliance management of development processes with critical system software engineering standard documents.
\par
This paper extends our previous work on process compliance management by capturing process knowledge using NLP tasks and rule-based matching. It also provides support for reverse compliance management and generates SPEM compliant process models, requirements and compliance mappings in the Eclipse Process Framework (EPF) Composer.
\par
This paper presents an ontology-based NLP approach for extracting requirements and processes embedded in the standard documents, and demonstrates its effectiveness for ECSS-E-ST-40C.
\par
The Object Management Group (OMG) standard SPEM 2.0 provides support for creating libraries of reusable method content and processes for performing projects. It also enables the configuration of process framework customized for a specific project's needs, and enactment of a process in real development projects.
\par
Process takes the content elements and relates them into workflows and/or break-down structures, and adapts them to a specific project context. It is made up of Activities and Activity Kinds.
\par
EPF Composer is an open-source process engineering framework, based on the conceptual framework of SPEM, and can be launched as a standalone application, but also in the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE). It provides authoring capabilities to define method content and process, and browsing perspective to publish the content.
\par
NLP is used in several applications such as speech recognition, machine translation, information retrieval and extraction. It is supported by text processing tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, morphology, and dependency parsing.
\par
Typically, NLP utilises rule or machine learning-based techniques for text processing. These techniques reduce the effort required by a human in document processing and information extraction.
\par
We use common text preprocessing tasks to extract the most basic syntactic features, and then develop an ontology for better interpretation of process elements. We then generate requirements, process and compliance mappings during planning phase, and support reverse compliance management during execution phase.
\par
To develop an ontology, the words and phrases are defined with their corresponding categories or groups to prepare application-specific (semantics) features. The ontology helps in better interpretation of extracted information, and the relationships between super- and subconcepts facilitate pattern definition for rule-based matching.
\par
The work product super concept is categorised into deliverable, outcome, and model subconcepts. The deliverable and outcome subconcepts are further categorised into documents and reports, and the model is further categorised into logical model, computational model, data model, functional model, and failure model.
\par
To extract information from standard documents, matching rules are defined based on syntactic features (e.g., POS tags, phrasal tags, etc.) and semantic features (ontology concepts and relations). The regular expressions are used to develop these rules, and the extracted information is compared with corresponding subconcepts.
\par
The operators and quantifiers are used in the regular expressions to facilitate information extraction from the complex sentences. The deontic operator indicator is also used in the matching rules to indicate the obligation, permission, or prohibition requirement types.
\par
The requirements sentences and associated information are retrieved. The expected output (outcome), optional prerequisites (inputs), and identifiers are interpreted as part of the Design Justification File, contained in the Software Verification Plan, and requested for the Preliminary Design Review.
\par
In the planning phase, information extracted from the standard documents is structured and mapped to requirements and SPEM 2.0 compliant processes. Nested requirements are created for the clauses, part-based distinction criteria and hierarchical levels.
\par
The extracted text is mapped to the guidance kinds, work products, inputs, prerequisites, outputs and stakeholder information. The tasks are assigned to specific roles, and the tasks are populated by applying tasks from the method content.
\par
We present our algorithmic solution for the generation of standard requirements, SPEM 2.0 compliant processes, as well as compliance mappings in EPF Composer. The requirements and process elements are generated in a structured way.
\par
The process plugin generates the ContentPackage and ProcessComponent for the main clauses, and the contentElements, such as tasks, roles, work products, are generated under ContentPackage.
\par
EPF Composer automatically creates delivery processes and capability patterns. These processes are broken down into phases, activities, and milestones, which are linked to requirements and subrequirements through activityReferences and contentReferences.
\par
The reverse compliance of updated and extended process models is required during the execution phase to detect inconsistencies, e.g., in work products. The EPF Composer model is processed in conjunction with the extracted and structured information of standard documents.
\par
The ECSS EARM file contains all requirements with their unique identifier, expected outputs, source reference, recommendations, permissions and informative text (notes) of the respective ECSS standard. It can be used for projects tailoring.
\par
EPF Composer automatically generates the requirements, process model and compliance mappings for the software validation process according to the SPEM 2.0. The requirements are generated as high-level practices, subconcepts are generated as subrequirements and subsubrequirements are generated as subsubrequirements.
\par
The MappingRequirements plugin automatically generates process models and compliance mappings from standard documents. The generated models and mappings can evolve during the life cycle, and missing elements are automatically added after approval.
\par
The ontology for software maintenance is divided into five subontologies: software system, users, documentation, computer science skills, modification process, organisational structure, and application domain. Post-mortem analysis is applied for eliciting maintenance knowledge, but the authors have not considered information extraction using NLP.
\par
The researchers focused on the generation of BPMN process models from natural language text. They used existing syntax parsing and semantic analysis mechanisms in combination with anaphora resolution to generate sound and complete models.
\par
Sanchez-Ferreres et al. used natural language processing techniques to align a textual description and a process model, and Winter et al. used natural language processing to assess compliance between paragraphs from a regulatory document and BPMN models.
\par
Governatori et al. [11] used the semantic web technologies and languages, such as LegalRuleML, to model a legal document and performed compliance checking using Regorous - a business process regulatory compliance checker.
\par
This paper leverages ontology-based NLP for process compliance management with standard documents, such as software system engineering processes. It supports information extraction and structuring of requirements, processes and mappings, and supports reverse compliance management of pre-existing or extended process models.
\par
This work is limited to software engineering processes embedded in a space standard, but future work will consider the extraction of process models from digital twins and the transformation of assurance cases to GSN format.},

This paper proposes a three-level index system for compliance management in China's electricity market. It also provides suggestions for improving compliance management.
\par
China's power market has been greatly influenced by the vertical integrated regulation, and the awareness, risk prevention and compliance for electric power companies are not strong. A three-level index system of compliance management is proposed to study the compliance management in China's electricity market.
\par
The research on the risk management system of the power market mainly focuses on the credit risk, transaction risk and regulatory risk. Zheng (2018) gave tips on main compliance risks faced by power trading institutions, and Jiang (2020) used analytic hierarchy process to evaluate the compliance risks of trading institutions.
\par
The importance of compliance management has become increasingly prominent with the development of the power market.
\par
The effectiveness of the electricity market compliance risk management system is evaluated by a three-level evaluation system based on compliance management system, business management compliance, electricity market compliance, and major risks.
\par
The compliance management system should consider five aspects, including the organization's structure, staffing, guarantees for personnel performance, institutional development, process construction, cultural progress and information system construction.
\par
The business management compliance indexes include six third level indicators.
\par
The compliance management system should consider the market environment and market entity management from the perspectives of non-compliance and deviation assessment.
\par
To ensure a scientific and comprehensive evaluation, it is necessary to determine the weight of each indicator based on a three level index system. This paper applies the weighting method for group decision to calculate the optimal weighting of each index.
\par
The expert can decide the weights of the indicators based on the AHP method.
\par
The weights of each index are determined based on the comparison matrix. If the consistency test is rejected, the comparison matrix needs to be adjusted.
\par
The weight of an index is decided by an expert, and its range is calculated.
\par
To determine a reasonable range of combination weights, we first reorder the index and test whether a point is a singularity. If there are no other points in the neighbourhood, x is regarded as a singular point.
\par
The final combination weight should consider the information given by all experts, and the objective function should be set according to the idea of minimum deviation.
\par
The comprehensive weight of third-grade index is calculated by combining the weights of the first, second, and third grade indexes.
\par
Three experts were invited to group decision on the suitability and effectiveness of the proposed framework. The final evaluation value of compliance management system in this case is 2.29.

The earlier security requirement engineering models focus different viewpoints on parallel processing and develop rewrite based knowledge centred models but does not include different functional mappings between the security objects to select the best strategy. The security models have not considered the needed security functions that are to be implemented in different environments with different levels of executions. The proposed requirement engineering model is based on the formal theory of category of objects and the morphisms between them in addition to n categories and multiple morphisms that were used to organize the security requirement functional objects of different categories. The on demand security requirement objects, morphisms and the uncertain events in any one of the subsystems are considered to manage this security requirement category as an algebraic data types. The collection of security requirement objects using classification and clustering techniques are implicitly applied by the formation of category and morphism. The risk and compliances both in the form of direct and indirect categories are mapped so as to provide a security assurance functors with minimum risk on the requirements to the next design state.

The network boundaries between tenants in a data centre are blurring, and the security requirements in VANET include message authentication, identity privacy preservation, traceability, unlinkability, non-repudiation, and various attack resistance. IoT security and privacy features include threat models and attack taxonomies from the health care perspective.
\par
Security policy restrains the behaviour of a system, and security goals and security requirements aim to protect assets from harm. Secondary security goals may be added, and additional functional and/or secondary security requirements added.
\par
Category theory is used to map objects to morphisms, whereas set theory is not sufficient for mapping security and compliance objects to morphisms.
\par
Figure 2 shows a two-dimensional morphism where the arrow Extends: Direct attack Direct threat leads to: Direct attack Direct threat.
\par
The direct threat category, direct data category, direct method category and direct damage category are grouped under security. The security inverse category, security governance category, security management category, security compliance category and security regulation category are grouped under compliance.
\par
The security infrastructure supports the security platform, the security services support the security platform, and the security services support the security exploitation. The exploitation may lead to direct threat, which includes direct methods and direct data, whereas direct threat may also include direct damage to the system.
\par
The requirements are categorized in to general requirement, defensive requirement, critical requirement, offensive requirement and assurance requirement. The general requirement communicates with the defensive requirement through security regulation policy.
\par
A practical framework for security risk assessment is developed based on model based security risk assessment by exploiting the synthesis of risk analysis. This framework describes the target of assessment at the right level of abstraction, facilitates communication and interaction between different groups of users involved in risk assessment, and documents the results.
\par
A mathematical approach is proposed to collect security requirement objects and group them based on their morphism on their different codomains. The software requirement document also describes the general requirement, defensive requirement, critical requirement, offensive requirement and assurance requirement.
\par
The table 2 describes the categories, whereas S represents security category and C represents compliance category. The objects in security category include infrastructure, platform, vulnerability, exploitation, direct attack, direct threat, direct damage, legality, law, maintenance, enforcement, design and architecture, security governance, security management, security compliance and security regulation.
\par
Software security requirements are classified based on their level of execution. Requirements engineering is done to satisfy domain security requirements.
\par
A distributed software system with multiple security types is analyzed with categorical theory and morphisms to identify the functional or type mapping between security objects. A cyber use case diagram is drawn for the cyber security requirements for the said software system.},

\par
In the global business environment, researchers and practitioners have been interested in knowledge transfer within and outside of a company. Especially, knowledge transfer is important for diversified firms because they exploit knowledge relatedness.
\par
Multi-business firms must follow many laws and regulations, many of which are complex and constantly changing. To avoid violation of new or changed laws, firms must understand the law, the current situation, and how to reduce potential violation.
\par
Previous studies reported that knowledge relatedness influences corporate performance, but this study focuses on compliance knowledge relatedness as a preceding factor affecting compliance performance. IT relatedness keeps the exploitation of compliance knowledge more efficient.
\par
This paper aims to explain how relatedness of compliance knowledge influences corporate compliance performance through exploitation of compliance knowledge, and what role IT plays in such a process.
\par
According to the resource-based view, firms exist to create new values by going through the learning process where the resources inside the organization interact with each other. Knowledge management is the process of combining and disseminating knowledge resources of the organization.
\par
In the context of compliance, knowledge relatedness means the level of using common knowledge resources among various business units of the multi-business company. If the benefits do not exceed the costs, knowledge relatedness cannot be achieved.
\par
The existing literature studies knowledge relatedness, and it is based on product, customer and managerial knowledge. Product knowledge relatedness, customer knowledge relatedness, and managerial knowledge relatedness are the major sources of cross-business knowledge synergy.
\par
The managerial knowledge of each business unit can be used to achieve cross-business synergy. This knowledge includes insights, experiences and best practices, and is acquired by other business units of the firm.
\par
Risk management is important in running businesses. Multi-business firms systematically react to business risk by exploiting common risk management principles and processes.
\par
To reduce the negative impact of non-compliance, firms need to be proactive to prevent non-compliance and try to reduce harmful influence of violations. This study views knowledge relatedness as the theme of risk management and closely examines the aspect of managerial knowledge.
\par
The concept of common knowledge includes not only knowledge relatedness, but also exploitation of shared knowledge by way of organizational learning processes. This study examined the use of compliance knowledge through the lens of exploitation.
\par
Based on RBV, many researchers have focused on how IT resources impact firm performance, and how IT resources play an important role in gaining competitive advantage. The ability to leverage IT infrastructure, human IT resource and IT-enabled intangible resources generates the firm's IT capability.
\par
Using information technology to attain organizational knowledge can impact learning outcomes, and knowledge management system provides infrastructure for reinforcing knowledge processes, thereby supporting creation of new knowledge. This knowledge can mitigate the firm's weaknesses in principle-based regulations, and help the firm agree with or accept these regulations over time.
\par
Tanriverdi's work shows that IT can improve interactions and knowledge sharing, which leads to better performance. This study hypothesizes that compliance knowledge can be exploited to improve performance.
\par
Information technology helps building the infrastructure to support knowledge-related behaviors at organizational level, enhances the knowledge management process, and facilitates communication and tacit knowledge creation. IT relatedness improves compliance process, which contributes to timely discussion on the exploitation of compliance knowledge.
\par
The present study surveyed 187 Korean businesses to investigate the knowledge related to compliance, IT relatedness, and knowledge exploitation level of each firm, as well as the compliance performance.
\par
This study focuses on managerial knowledge relatedness and measures compliance knowledge relatedness by three dimensions: prevention knowledge relatedness, detection knowledge relatedness, and responsive knowledge relatedness.
\par
Tanriverdi (2005) suggested four dimensions of IT relatedness, including IT infrastructure, IT strategy and IT human resource.
\par
This study measured compliance performance in three dimensions, depending on managerial features of a vast array of areas.
\par
Comply with trading/competition laws and regulations, administrative laws and regulations, and operational laws and regulations.
\par
This study controls for industry impact, firm size, and years of operation by using dummy variables, total revenue, and business years of operation.
\par
All constructs were measured with a five-point Likert-scale, except compliance performance, which was measured on an 11-point scale.
\par
The data were analyzed using SPSS and the reliability was evaluated by Cronbach alpha value. A research model was confirmed using regression and the mediating effect was confirmed using 3 step analysis.
\par
The reliability of the scale is high, and the factor loadings are .7 or more. All variables met the criteria for convergent validity, and discriminant validity was verified by the square root of the average variance extracted (AVE).
\par
The correlations among the constructs were relatively high, but the first principle component explained no more than half of the overall variance, suggesting that common method bias was not a serious threat in this study.
\par
Table 2 shows the correlation of several variables, and it is confirmed that knowledge exploitation is positively correlated with compliance performance.
\par
Hypothesis 1 of this study was adopted because it showed statistically significant effects of compliance knowledge relatedness on compliance performance.
\par
This study used the method proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986) to verify mediating effects, and found that knowledge exploitation had a partial mediating effect on the relationship between compliance knowledge relatedness and CP1 and CP3, and a full mediating effect on the relationship between compliance knowledge relatedness and CP2.
\par
The interaction effect of compliance knowledge relatedness with IT relatedness on knowledge exploitation was statistically significant.
\par
The moderating effect of IT relatedness on the relationship between compliance knowledge relatedness and knowledge exploitation can be seen in figure 2.
\par
The relationship between compliance knowledge relatedness and knowledge exploitation is positively enhanced when IT relatedness is high. The indirect effect between compliance knowledge relatedness and knowledge exploitation varies by the level of IT relatedness.
\par
This study examines the effects of compliance knowledge synergies on corporate compliance performance. It finds that corporate compliance performance is improved when the firm simultaneously exploits a complementary set of related compliance knowledge resources across its business units.
\par
This study verified the role of knowledge relatedness as an antecedent of compliance performance, and verified that active knowledge exploitation is more important than raising relatedness itself.
\par
This study was conducted at the corporate level and used compliance managers as its subjects, which makes it more significant.
\par
This study focuses on the managerial features of different fields of compliance, and analyzes compliance performance in three dimensions: trading/competition, administration, and operational laws and regulations. It offers useful insights to companies on how to improve the exploitation level of compliance knowledge.
\par
This paper has several limitations, such as not directly showing evidence for causality between constructs and not investigating how knowledge relatedness influences knowledge exploitation and performance over time.
\par
This study's results are still exposed to common method bias, and data collection needs to be diversified to avoid this issue. Also, using quantitative indicators to measure compliance level can eliminate this issue.
\par
The research results might be influenced by the nationality, race, and culture of the research subjects.
\par
This study aims to examine corporate compliance management and how relatedness to compliance knowledge affects compliance performance. It also identifies factors that influence compliance performance and how relatedness to compliance knowledge influences knowledge exploitation.},

\par
Information system vulnerabilities are weaknesses in an information system that could be exploited by a threat source, and information security threats are malware, phishing, proxies, spyware, adware, botnets, and spam.
\par
Information system vulnerability is present when employees do not comply with the organizations' information security policy (ISP) requirements, placing organizational resources at risk.
\par
Several theories have been used to study variables that influence ISP compliance, including the theory of planned behavior, the theory of protection motivation, formal/informal theories that include severity and certainty, and the theory of information security awareness.
\par
Leadership is defined as "...the process of interactive influence" (see ref. 23), while Yukl defined leadership as "... a group process involving interaction between at least two persons in pursuit of a goal". Researchers have confirmed that leadership influences employees' compliance with information security policy requirements.
\par
Researchers have studied various factors that influence employees' intention to comply with ISP requirements, including organizational culture, threat perceptions, rewards, and employees' perceived severity.
\par
Trust has been viewed as an imperative element for organizational success. Trust is linked to many activities, traits, and attributes in organizations, such as inter-organizational cooperation, team performance, reducing costs and improving ability to handle complexity, long-term relationships, and effective implementation of strategies.
\par
Role values were proposed as a new construct by Moody, Siponen \& Pahnila13 and are comprised of nine factors from four constructs: self-concept, roles, perceived behavioral control, affect, and moral definitions. They asserted that role values were the most significant justification for ISP compliance.
\par
Scholars agree that information security awareness is a determinant variable of information security policy compliance. Information security awareness impacts an employee's attitude to comply with the information security policy, therefore safeguarding information security within organizations.
\par
The leadership construct defines the role of leadership in articulating a clear vision, formulating a clear strategy, and establishing clear goals/objectives for achieving effective information security to protect the organization's assets against threats.
\par
Employees' trusting beliefs about ISP requirements are: my organization has the skills and knowledge to implement ISP requirements, my organization's ISP requirements are meant for the best interest of the organization and employees.
\par
The role values construct includes nine items that describe whether an individual feels guilty if they violate their organization's information security policy, feels that it is consistent with their principles, and feels that it is never acceptable to walk away from compliance.
\par
The ISP awareness construct is about employees' awareness about rules and regulations of the ISP requirements, and their understanding of their responsibilities regarding the ISP requirements.
\par
This construct is about employees' intention to comply with the requirements of the ISP. It also includes the items to protect information and technology resources and carry out responsibilities.
\par
We electronically administered a survey instrument to 1472 employees of a university in the USA and received 257 responses. We eliminated 20 incomplete surveys and had 237 completed surveys.
\par
We chose multiple regression analysis, the Enter method, to analyze the data. The analysis shows which independent variables can best predict the dependent variable.
\par
The model fit is determined by the correlation coefficient, the coefficient of determination, and the adjusted coefficient of determination.
\par
We used SPSS to eliminate outliers, establish non-multicollinearity among independent variables, and fit the model to predict ISP compliance. The coefficients table showed that leadership, trusting beliefs, role values, and ISP awareness were significant predictors of ISP compliance.
\par
We built a prediction model to find out which four variables predict ISP compliance. The findings indicated that all four variables were influential in predicting ISP compliance.
\par
The findings indicated that leadership is a predictor of employees' ISP compliance. Leadership must articulate a clear vision for the ISP within organizations, formulate a clear strategy for achieving effective ISP, and establish clear goals and objectives for attaining effective ISP.
\par
The findings revealed that employees' trusting beliefs toward organizations' ISP requirements are a predictor of ISP compliance. In addition, trust influences people's intentions and behaviors, and leadership positively impacts employees' trust to effectively perform requirements of the ISP within organizations.
\par
The findings implied that role values are a predictor of ISP compliance. Leadership and training should pay attention to individuals' role values when designing ISP compliance training programs.
\par
Security education training awareness programs significantly impact employees' information security awareness. Security policies and employees' knowledge are the most influential antecedents of information security awareness.
\par
Future research should focus on innovative design of ISP compliance training programs. These programs should include necessary knowledge and skills to ensure that employees understand IS breaches, threats, and risks.
\par
This study showed that leadership, trusting beliefs, role values, and ISP awareness are influential in predicting the success of employees' intention to comply with the ISP requirements. These predictor variables are essential to the success of employees' IS compliance.},

\par
The information security threat is real and growing rapidly. To avoid or minimize the threat, organizations depend on employees' compliance with information security policy, which reduces security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities, therefore protecting organizations' assets.
\par
This paper reviews the literature on information security policy compliance and proposes a unified model of information security policy compliance (UMISPC) consisting of eight constructs (habit, role values, response efficacy, threat, fear, intention, neutralization, and reactance).
\par
Habits are regular tendencies or practices toward complying with the ISP that do not require individuals' awareness. They can be functional in obtaining certain goals and end states.
\par
The role values construct is a set of nine items derived from various behavioral theories previously studied in the literature. These items include guilt, reliability, walking away, accepting that complying with ISP is one's work style, control over breaking ISP, and morally wrong.
\par
The theory of neutralization is a way for individuals to rationalize retreating from social norms and deterrent mechanisms to engage in deviant behaviors, such as information security policy violation.
\par
Response efficacy is linked to Information Security Policy compliance. Compliance with Information Security Policy increases if it is perceived to prevent a security threat.
\par
Individuals' intention to conform to information security policy compliance depends on their risk assessment of the threat and the vulnerability associated with a particular control.
\par
Fear refers to individuals' negative emotional response to incentives. Several studies have adapted the protection motivation theory (PMT) theory to explain the effects of fear appeals on attitudes and behaviors.
\par
Reactance is the individuals' denial of the existence of the information security system problems. It is manifested by several factors, including emotional response to restricted choice, reactance to compliance, resisting influence from others, and reactance toward advice and recommendations.
\par
The intention of an individual to comply with the requirements of the information security policy of the organization.
\par
Habits are learned sequences of acts that become automatic responses to specific situations.
\par
Response efficacy awareness may cause fear, which initiates cognitive appraisal concerning the seriousness of a perceived threat, which in turn causes an individual's intention to comply with the ISP.
\par
Psychological reactance refers to individuals' denial of the existence of information security system problems. Fear may positively influence psychological reactance.
\par
People rationalize reasons to make exceptions to policies, rules, and laws, and thereby violate the accepted norm. This may influence their denial of information security system problems.
\par
The instrument includes eight constructs based on Moody et al.19, which measure fear, habit, neutralization, reaction, response efficacy, role values, and threat to others.
\par
We administered a survey instrument to the faculty and staff of a medium-sized university in the Southeast USA, and received over 600 responses in six weeks. We then used 192 responses from weeks 3 and 4, and eliminated 3 for incomplete data.
\par
We used SmartPLS 3.0 to analyze the data and established the reliability and validity of the research model. Then, we assessed the structural model using R2, Q2, and PLS Predict.
\par
The reliability of the indicator ROLE VALUES could not be achieved because of the outer loadings of four indicators being below.70.
\par
The reliability of the research model was established by indicator reliability and internal consistency. All indicators were above .70 and the composite reliability of all eight latent variables was above .70.
\par
The validity of the research model is established by the convergent validity and discriminant validity. The discriminant validity is shown by three analyses: the Fornell-Larcker criterion, the cross-loadings, and the heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations.
\par
The structural model was assessed through coefficient of determination (R2), blindfolding-based cross-validated redundancy measure Q2, PLS Predict, and the path coefficients. All of the constructs had acceptable values for R2 and Q2, indicating good predictive relevance of the PLS-path model.
\par
The PLS-SEM model has a medium to high predictive power, as only two RMSE values (FEAR1 and INTENT3) were higher in the PLS-SEM model than in the linear regression model.
\par
The results of the study hypotheses show that: (1) Habit did not significantly influence an individual's intention to comply with ISP. (2) Role values significantly influenced an individual's intention to comply with ISP.
\par
This study showed that the UMISPC model developed by Moody et al.19, which includes eight constructs, explained information security policy compliance. The model showed good reliability and internal consistency, and had high convergent validity and discriminant validity.
\par
The findings for the study's hypotheses are that habit does not significantly predict ones' intention to comply with ISP. Despite this finding, organizations should continue to recognize individuals' positive habits and encourage them through various means of communication and training methods for successful compliance with the ISP.
\par
Role values were found to significantly predict ones' intention to comply with ISP. The construct of role values in the model for the present study included indicators 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8.
\par
The four indicators for ROLE VALUES were eliminated from the study. However, future studies should examine the mediation effect between role values and other constructs in determining ISP compliance.
\par
The findings suggest that response efficacy predicts threat, fear, and reactance, and that fear negatively and significantly influences reactance, and that neutralization predicts reactance.
\par
We examined the reliability, validity, and strength of the unified model for information security policy compliance (UMISPC) developed by Moody et al.19, and showed that the model explained information security policy compliance through eight constructs: role values, habit, neutralization, threat, fear, response efficacy, reactance, and compliance intention.
\par
This study used a sample of convenience to study faculty and staff at a mid-sized university. It recommends that future studies use a random sample and measure prospective behavior.},

  abstract = {The introduction of compliance management systems is becoming more and more important in Russian companies. Initially limited to anti-corruption compliance and driven by foreign extraterritorial legislation, corporate leaders are now considering the benefits of enhanced risk management systems. From a corporate law perspective, the driving force behind this is the business judgement rule. Corporate leaders should be encouraged to take reasonable entrepreneurial risks without fearing liability. Therefore, by adopting compliance and risk management systems corporate leaders will be able to exculpate themselves when business decisions go wrong and losses are suffered. But the question is who will be the driving force in the Russian corporate context: the executive director or the board of directors? This paper examines two strands of domestic compliance regulation: anti-corruption compliance and the 2014 Code of Corporate Governance. It shows that while there are grounds for the possibility that in Russia the executive directors will be the drivers of compliance, the greater likelihood is that the board of directors will be collectively responsible. Important incentives for the day-to-day management of the companies will therefore most likely be missed. \textcopyright{} 2018, Supporting Academic Initiatives Foundation. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Monitoring financial transactions is a critical Anti-Money Laundering (AML) obligation for financial institutions. In recent years, machine learning-based transaction monitoring systems have successfully complemented traditional rule-based systems to reduce the high number of false positives and the effort needed to review all the alerts manually. Unfortunately, machine learning-based solutions also have disadvantages: while unsupervised models can detect novel anomalous patterns, they are usually characterized by a high number of false alarms; supervised models, instead, usually offers a higher detection rate but require a large amount of labeled data to achieve such performance. In this paper, we present Amaretto, an active learning framework for money laundering detection that combines unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to support the transaction monitoring processes by improving the detection performance and reducing the compliance management costs. Amaretto exploits novel selection strategies to target a subset of transactions for investigation, making more efficient use of the feedback provided by the analyst. We perform the experimental evaluation on a synthetic dataset provided by the industrial partner, which simulates the profiles of clients trading in international capital markets. We show that Amaretto outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by reducing money laundering risk and improving detection performance. In particular, we compare state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised techniques commonly used in the AML domain with the ones implemented in this work. We show that the Isolation and Random Forests of Amaretto perform best in the task under analysis, with an AUROC of 0.9 for the first (20\% better on average) and a detection rate of 0.793 for the second (30\% better on average). In addition, they are characterized by lower investigation costs computed in terms of the daily number of transactions to be examined and the number of false positives and false negatives. Finally, we compare Amaretto against a state-of-the-art active learning fraud detection system, achieving better detection performances and lower costs in all the analyzed scenarios. Worth mentioning, Amaretto improves the detection rate up to 50\% and reduces the overall cost by 20\% in the most realistic scenario under analysis.},

Money laundering is the process by which illegal income is introduced into the financial system. It generates between \$1.6-2.85 trillion per year, equivalent to 2.1\%-4\% of the Gross World Product.
\par
An expert system is used to implement anti-money laundering procedures by deploying rules that are configured to monitor pre-determined unusual behaviors. The system generates alerts if rules are triggered, but the rules need to be updated to ensure they capture changes.
\par
Machine learning enhances traditional AML techniques by extracting patterns and insights from data and identifying unusual correlations unknown to subject matter experts. Active learning is used to collect data faster.
\par
Amaretto is an active learning system that combines unsupervised and supervised models organized in an analyst-in-the-loop framework to detect money laundering patterns.
\par
We perform an experimental evaluation on a synthetic dataset to determine the best performing unsupervised and supervised techniques for the detection of money laundering activities. We conclude that Amaretto outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by improving the detection rate and reducing the compliance management costs.
\par
We used a dataset generated by our industry partners to detect money laundering.
\par
Several systematic review papers have been published on machine learning applied to the fraud and money laundering detection domains. The main principle in money laundering detection is to quantify how a transaction (or group of transactions) deviates from the norm.
\par
Le-Khack and Kechadi suggest an approach for detecting anomalies in investment funds based on clustering profiles into categories and feeding a Backpropagation Neural Network with the transformed data.
\par
Torres and Ladeira [24] propose a hybrid approach to reduce the incidence of false positives in financial transaction analysis.
\par
Unsupervised models tend to generate false positives, and supervised learning is used when labels are available. In the fraud detection domain, Random Forest outperforms Support Vector Machines and Linear Regression across all metrics used for the comparison.
\par
In the AML domain, the most common used techniques are Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, deep neural networks, and rule-based systems. Gradient bosting techniques have been successfully exploited in the last year.
\par
Tertychny et al. [31] propose a two-layered ensembled modeling approach to address the AML detection domain.
\par
Vassallo et al. [33] propose an adaptation of the XGBoost algorithm and compare various offline decision tree-based ensembles, demonstrating that gradient boosting outperforms random forest results.
\par
Supervised learning outperforms unsupervised learning in anomaly detection, but requires a large amount of labeled data and is less effective at detecting new anomalous patterns.
\par
Amaretto implements an active learning system combining both supervised and unsupervised learning, leveraging their strengths and mitigating their weaknesses. The system uses a model that queries a subject matter expert to label transactions (suspicious or genuine) to minimize manual data reviews.
\par
Amaretto focuses on reducing the cost and risk of manually reviewing multiple transactions by evaluating the main insights of the presented research works. It also optimizes the selection strategy for AML investigators.
\par
Alarab et al. [39] present a novel approach to predict illicit transactions in the Bitcoin transaction graph.
\par
To evaluate Amaretto, we use a synthetic dataset generated by our industry partner using a custom-built data generator. This dataset allows reproducibility of the results and a fair comparison with future works.
\par
The dataset contains 29,704,090 transactions executed by 400 end clients buying and selling specific securities in a specific market. Most transactions were executed during market opening hours, and a small percentage were executed during the early morning hours and at the end of the day.

We generated five classes of anomalies based on examples of suspicious patterns suggested by FATF, and injected them into the dataset to reinforce the concept that anomalous transactions are well hidden.
\par
We opted for a hybrid solution using active learning to detect money laundering. The system uses both unsupervised and supervised techniques in an analyst in-the-loop framework.
\par
Amaretto uses models to aggregate transactional data across a specific timeframe, to generate features that capture the behavioral profile of a customer, and to compute an anomaly score for each new vector. A selection strategy is then used to send transactions to the domain expert for review.
\par
Amaretto generates a set of high-level features based on the time the transactions were aggregated. The time windows are 1 hour, 1 day, 7 days, and 1 month and are used to capture the short-term, mid-term, and long-term behavior of the user.
\par
We used Isolation Forest to detect anomalous patterns in data, even if they are present in small amounts, and to deal with random noise.
\par
The system uses an Isolation Forest to generate anomaly scores for each customer and compare different behaviors to select transactions for investigation.
\par
Amaretto uses Random Forest as its supervised model. This model performs better than other supervised models.
\par
The SELECT-TOP strategy selects the top anomalous vectors based on the anomaly score generated by the Isolation Forest.
\par
The SELECT-DIVERSE strategy uses clustering to group similar high-level vectors and draws samples from each cluster based on the anomaly score until the desired number of samples has been reached.
\par
The stability of a cluster is determined by the stability of its children. If the stability of a cluster is greater than its children, it is selected.
\par
The Random Forest classifier is used to select the most anomalous vectors and the least anomalous aggregated transactions.
\par
The system selects the high-level vectors for which the two models show the most uncertainty using the SELECT-ENTROPY and SELECT-CONFLICT strategies.
\par
The SELECT-CONFLICT strategy selects samples if the supervised and unsupervised models disagree on whether the vectors are anomalous or not.
\par
Amaretto combines the power of Random Forest and Isolation Forest to predict anomalous instances. The resulting anomaly scores are transformed into probabilities using the Weibull distribution, and the ensemble predictions are redefined using the new anomaly scores.
\par
In this section, we describe the experiments conducted to assess the performance and effectiveness of Amaretto. We compare the Isolation Forest used in Amaretto with state-of-the-art unsupervised solutions, and we test the unsupervised techniques to assess their prediction ability with different daily budgets.
\par
We split the testing data on a daily basis to fully test the system on a daily working routine, and used a walk-forward testing approach to achieve a suitable detection rate whilst minimizing the effort of the subject matter expert in reviewing the samples.
\par
We used Bayesian Optimization to find the best hyper-parameter values.
\par
To evaluate Amaretto, we define True Positive, False Positive, False Negative, and True Negative as follows.
\par
The AUROC and the ROC curve are useful indicators for benchmarking algorithms, and the Precision-Recall Curve and the Cost Metric are useful to account for class imbalance and different classification costs.
\par
In [50], 100 was suggested as a reasonable estimation of the cost ratio between false positives and false negatives. This metric takes into account the real costs of anomalous transactions.
\par
We compare state-of-the-art unsupervised solutions with the Isolation Forest used in Amaretto, and find that the Isolation Forest exhibits the best performance with an AUROC of 0.9.
\par
We compare the Random Forest model with state-of-the-art models based on Gradient and Category Boosting techniques on a dataset composed of 7,327,387 transactions.
\par
Table 4 compares the average metrics for each technique. The CatBoost model achieves the highest Precision, but Random Forest achieves the highest TPR and the lowest FNR.
\par
We perform several runs of this experiment to test the performance of the supervised and unsupervised techniques employed in Amaretto to detect new anomalous patterns. The results show that the Isolation Forest model performs consistently, while Random Forest performs poorly.
\par
The purpose of this experiment is to test which of the strategies is most suitable for our dataset. We chose the system that employs SELECT-DIVERSE and SELECT-ENTROPY (Amaretto \_3, red bar in Figure 7b) because it provides the best overall average Precision and AUC.
\par
We compare Amaretto with AI 2, which uses an ensemble of three unsupervised techniques for anomaly detection. The feedback from the expert is used to train a Random Forest.
\par
In this experiment, we compare the performance of three frameworks in three different scenarios: static scenario, real-world scenario, and real-world scenario with risk profiles.
\par
To verify the framework's performance with a minimum amount of training data, the inner module is used for the first 10 days of the test set, collecting 100 samples. This dataset is then used to train a Random Forest model.
\par
In the second part of the experiment, the Random Forest is applied alongside the unsupervised machine learning techniques in the active learning loop and the prediction phase. Amaretto achieves a maximum average precision of 0.78, while AI 2 0.57.
\par
In the last part of the experiment, we tested different threshold values for the probability score corresponding to different use cases. Amaretto outperformed AI 2 across all thresholds, achieving a TPR of 0.428\% in the low-risk use case.
\par
This research work uses two composing algorithms, Random Forest and Isolation Forest, that function as rule-based trees, but the resulting probability does not provide helpful insight into the result.
\par
The available dataset is very limited in timespan, and a broader dataset would have allowed us to analyze the system's evolution over time deeply. We also assumed that the subject matter expert provided correct labels when reviewing the data.
\par
We aimed to build the simplest and lightest active learning system to outperform state-of-the-art solutions. However, we found that deep learning models performed poorly on real-world datasets, and future works may explore applying deep learning algorithms to detect other financial crimes.
\par
In this paper, we presented Amaretto, an active learning system for anomaly detection applied to transaction monitoring for money laundering detection in capital markets. We demonstrated that the system achieved state-of-the-art performance within a short time frame and with minimal manual input from a subject matter expert.},

The financial service industry, in general, is strongly regulated and has to follow specific laws, standards and guidelines. However, research has shown that little attention is being paid to Value Added Tax (VAT) issues, although there is a high cost and risk exposure, especially in large international companies which use large IT-Infrastructures for tax handling. In this paper, we examine a commonly applied approach for the verification of VAT regulations within Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERP) and highlight weaknesses as well as error susceptibilities. Furthermore, we show that machine learning techniques can be utilized to minimize risks and increase VAT compliance. We use a supervised learning classifier to predict tax subjects and corresponding tax rates based on related voucher information of journal reports. By comparing the results of our model with the existing rule-based system of an ERP system, we reveal potential anomalies and compliance issues. Our approach was evaluated on a given real-world data set of a leading chemical industry company that was exported from its ERP system. The results were validated by VAT experts of the company. \textcopyright{} 2019 IEEE.},

wordtune summary
\par
In order to help enterprises effectively avoid risks and maintain long-term and stable development, a compliance management and supervision system is constructed under the Internet environment. ADR is used to analyze and deal with conflicts and disputes.
\par
The rapid development of market economy makes the competition more intense, and the risk factors are more complex. Compliance management can ensure that interests are protected.
\par
Compliance management is important for the survival and development of an enterprise, and it helps the enterprise to comply with laws and regulations, regulatory requirements, industry guidelines and corporate charters, rules and regulations, as well as international treaties and rules.
\par
ADR is a method of dispute resolution other than litigation and arbitration. ADR can lead to mutual understanding and trust between parties, and may even lead to new business transactions.
\par
The current operation of enterprises has not formed a scientific compliance management system.
\par
Enterprises need to update their strategic goals to meet the current changes in the business environment and national policies, and to promote corporate compliance management to the strategic level.
\par
Corporate compliance management is comprehensive and requires the mobilization of all employees of the company. In addition, most compliance managers are drawn from the review and audit department, legal and risk control, and have insufficient effective reserve.
\par
The current problems of corporate compliance management are mainly caused by a lack of internal control and evaluation, and the lack of a dedicated internal audit organization or position. The lack of supervision for various departments of the enterprise and production links also causes loopholes in corporate compliance management.
\par
A compliance management system should integrate setting goals with compliance goals and improve the compliance management level in the cycle.
\par
Control activities are management activities designed and executed to solve risks; effective information and communication is carried out to ensure compliance; monitoring activities ensure the effective operation of control activities and evaluate the compliance risk management system.
\par
The purpose of corporate compliance management is to effectively control compliance risks. ADR can be used to handle disputes arising in the process of enterprise management, and the demand for dispute resolution gives justification and motivation for arbitration establishment.
\par
The implementation of enterprise conflict and dispute resolution should establish a special institution, such as a labor union, to exercise negotiation power on behalf of the enterprise, and relevant legislation can be invoked to legally empower negotiation bodies and promulgate relevant industry standards.
\par
Third-party participation in dispute resolution is introduced in due course to ensure the fairness of dispute resolution. This firewall ensures the objectivity and impartiality of the position and provides appropriate time and space for easing the tension and antagonism.
\par
ADR mechanisms can reduce management risks, but corresponding solutions and supervision measures are also necessary.
\par
A compliance culture is needed for enterprises to make scientific planning for the vision of enterprise development. Companies must develop compliance habits and integrate compliance systems and processes into corporate strategies.
\par
Clarify the organization of corporate compliance risk management and standardize the management organization, and appoint the senior management to be fully responsible for compliance risk management.
\par
The Compliance Management Department focuses on compliance risks and adopts methods to avoid the occurrence of compliance risks; the Internal Audit Department audits the management of internal control, risk management and compliance risk management.
\par
Inspection and supervision of corporate compliance management should be strengthened by cultivating corporate compliance culture, perfecting compliance management system and improving compliance management training, and by establishing standards to test the effectiveness of compliance management and continuously improving the regulatory and statutory system for corporate compliance management.
\par
Compliance management system is used to reduce business management risks and maintain healthy development of enterprises by complying with laws and regulations and implementing internal rules and regulations.},

Governing public enterprise BPs requires the ability to control and guide BP activities according to applied laws. Ensuring compliance of processes with legal regulations becomes a critical government requirement. This paper proposes an ontology-based framework for regulatory-compliance management that provides an integrated view of the law architecture model, public enterprise model, and BP lifecycle to enable the design of compliance solutions that cover the full business process compliance lifecycle, i.e., design time, runtime, and offline monitoring and analysis. The proposed framework is based on an integrated semantic model representing the business process model and administrative laws concepts which provide a shared conceptualization of the BP activities and the related legal rules. This work seeks to lay down the requirements of an integrated architecture for semantic regulatorycompliance management in the context of the BP management lifecycle. The focus of this paper is the design-time compliance approach. Our proposed design-time compliance solution was validated using a running example from the Universal Health Insurance program of Egypt.},

This paper (1) reviews 11 theories that have served the majority of previous information security behavior models, (2) empirically compares these theories (Study 1), (3) proposes a unified model, called the unified model of information security policy compliance (UMISPC), which integrates elements across these extant theories, and (4) empirically tests the UMISPC in a new study (Study 2), which provided preliminary empirical support for the model. The 11 theories reviewed are (1) the theory of reasoned action, (2) neutralization techniques, (3) the health belief model, (4) the theory of planned behavior, (5) the theory of interpersonal behavior, (6) the protection motivation theory, (7) the extended protection motivation theory, (8) deterrence theory and rational choice theory, (9) the theory of self-regulation, (10) the extended parallel processing model, and (11) the control balance theory. The UMISPC is an initial step toward empirically examining the extent to which the existing models have similar and different constructs. Future research is needed to examine to what extent the UMISPC can explain different types of ISS behaviors (or intentions thereof). Such studies will determine the extent to which the UMISPC needs to be revised to account for different types of ISS policy violations and the extent to which the UMISPC is generalizable beyond the three types of ISS violations we examined. Finally, the UMISPC is intended to inspire future ISS research to further theorize and empirically demonstrate the important differences between rival theories in the ISS context that are not captured by current measures.},

Among the key challenges in managing the evolution of software are the modelling and the enforcement of compliance rules.

  abstract = {Today's business entities face an ever-growing number of laws and regulations due to recent high profile business scandals and failures. Small and medium scale enterprises (SMSE) in developing countries do not have an efficient compliance checking mechanism to make their business processes compliant with these regulatory standards. This checking mechanism is needed to give the enterprises full assurance of complete adherence to regulatory standards, bodies, or Service Level Agreements. Therefore, a structured and efficient compliance management model is needed to aid SMSE in launching their businesses safely and to ensure business processes fit into the classical regulatory standards. This paper presents a business rules compliance checking model and architecture for SMSEs in developing countries to verify and monitor their business process models at design time and at run time. It involves a systematic compliance requirements classification and analysis that employs a goal based requirement engineering approach prior to design time verification. It also introduces the idea and demonstration of network analysis for runtime business processes monitoring. The business process model will be verified at design time using a Simple PROMELA Interpreter model checker through Linear Temporal Logic rules. The approaches were tested on a financial institution in Nigeria, a developing nation in Africa at the time of this research. In order to ensure that the choice of the requirements analysis approach was efficient, a number of standard metrics for evaluating requirements engineering techniques were used and promising results were obtained. We also carried out a comparative analysis of the proposed approach in this paper with the approaches of previous research papers. This approach proved to be effective in terms of clarity, simplicity, flexibility and expressiveness while reducing incomplete adherence of business processes and enhancing the correctness of the business process. \textcopyright{} 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

  abstract = {One crucial aspect that had cost business organizations so much is management of compliance requirements from various regulatory sources. In a bid to avoid being penalized, some organizations have adopted various techniques to accomplish this task. However, literature revealed that few thorough reviews have been centered on this subject in a systematic way. This implies that a review that systematically captured the entire crucial elements such as implementation environment, constraints types addressed, main contributions and strengths of the existing techniques is missing. This has led to the lack of sufficiently good context of operation.

Various techniques have been adopted to manage compliance requirements from various regulatory sources, but a systematic review of existing literatures is missing. This paper presents a lead-up for appropriately positioning new research activities based on the combined importance of each criterion that was defined in this work.
\par
Business processes are the groups of related tasks that help an organization deliver its product or service.
\par
Business processes are defined by inputs and outputs, and a number of factors contribute to service or product value. BPCM is a measure and process put in place to ensure that activities in a business process are in line with their compliance requirements.
\par
The management of business process compliance is being shifted towards the cloud since many organizations are beginning to adopt this new technology. A systematic review of the implementation environment as well as compliance constraints is required to help organizations manage the compliance issues.
\par
A systematic literature review relating to BPCM is presented in this paper. The review used a template for review proposed by Biolchini et al. (2005) and was executed using the guideline proposed by Kitchenham (2004, 2007).
\par
The research questions focus on the identification of initiatives and reports of experiences in Software Engineering with the consideration of business process constraints types, environments and approaches from the very commencement of the BPCM process so as to develop an effective, efficient, easy-to-use and flexible business processes compliance management.
\par
A systematic literature review will position appropriately activities of researches in business process compliance management.
\par
The research questions were formulated to aid the provision of knowledge in terms of the compliance requirements researchers have focused on the most in their research works, to aid their innovation of ideas, and to reveal the gap in terms of research focus.
\par
A systematic review of literature sources was conducted to select primary studies for the execution of the study. The search string ''Compliance AND Business Processes'' was used, as well as article title, abstract, and keywords for conducting searches.
\par
The taxonomy shows that business process compliance requirements can be categorized into four major requirements: dataflow requirements, control flow requirements, timing requirements, and resource allocation. The selected literatures will be classified into implementation environment, approach type, and comparative analysis.
\par
The search was done to obtain a number of studies for evaluating them further. 28 studies satisfied the criteria to providing answers to the research questions.
\par
The designed template for this systematic review is made up of study identification, methodology, results, strengths and weaknesses, and a brief outline of the individual selected studies.

\par
New techniques, methodologies, and processes have been developed to facilitate the compliance management of business models. These techniques are based on formal and model checking techniques.
\par
The table presents a summary of the initiatives comparison intended to analyze each initiative. Using a proposed analytical framework, the following technical criteria were used to analyze each initiative: diagrammatic description, textual description of formal approach, background understanding required, and tool support. The four major compliance requirement types considered in the business process compliance management approaches are data flow constraint, control flow constraint, resource allocation, and timing constraint. The summary of research contributions in Table 4 reveals that the approaches have been more of formal techniques compared to model checking and semantics.
\par
This paper analyzes business process compliance in the cloud environment. It suggests a technique based on the combined importance of each criterion.
\par
The textual description of the formal technique employed by an approach explicitly expressed would aid researchers in basically comprehending the foundation of such approach. The flexibility of an approach can be determined from the researcher and the business domain where the compliance management technique intends to be employed.
\par
The analysis showed that the data flow and control flow constraints have been put more into consideration compared to the temporal and resource allocation constraints. This constraint is vital to business organizations because it affects customer satisfaction.
\par
This review provides a consistent result about the compliance of business processes that cannot be undermined through the use of a formally, systematically and unbiased methodology.
\par
The temporal and resource allocation requirements have been under researched in BPCM. The approaches employed are model checking, patterns, semantic, formal (LTL, CTL, MTL), ontology, goal-based requirements analysis and network analysis.
\par
This research work summarized existing information about business process compliance management and made a provision for context that could be used to operate. It also addressed gaps discovered from the research and proposed solutions for managing compliance requirements in the cloud environment.
\par
Compliance requirements are statements got from regulatory bodies and standards to guide the operations of a business process in an industrial domain. Business processes are modeled using programming tools or platform to adhere to compliance requirements.},

This study developed a rating model that can distinguish ``importance'' based on an objective standard. Fourteen components that can evaluate the importance of corporate information were derived from the related literature and verified for validity and reliability using factor analysis to organize final rating factors, such as Cost of Information Creation, Level of Information, Information Utilization, Effect of Internal Utilization, and Risk of External Leakage. A secondary survey targeted field experts to set the relative weights between five rating factors and give the relative weights for Effect of Internal Utilization Risk of External Leakage. A corporate information classification system was then designed to grades importance using the five factors. A final rating model of corporate information is suggested by defining security activity by level, granted by grade. This model is designed for corporate use and is expected to benefit economic security activity.},

These expensive adjustments result in compliance management becoming an enormous cost driver. It seems all the more surprising that there is still a large research gap in terms of quantitative measures for assessing the efficiency of compliance in business processes. This challenge primarily motivates the topic of this paper, as an economic assessment of business process compliance (BPC) becomes increasingly relevant. Based on a systematic and rigorous literature review, this paper provides an overview of current research and thereupon investigates concepts to economic assessment of BPC with a focus on quantitative measures. The analysis shows that not all contributions dealt to the same extent with the economic assessment of BPC and that the resulting concepts cannot be strictly separated from one another.},

  annotation = {1 citations (Crossref) [2022-06-09]},
  note = {wordtune summary
\par
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are crucial for any economy, but many cannot compete effectively because of their internal resource gap. Accounting practitioners are known to be the most commonly used small business advisors, but previous studies have reported mixed results regarding the economic benefits that SMEs obtain from this relationship.
\par
The frequency of sourcing accounting services influences the perceived benefits obtained. SMEs that source tax planning services and routine accounting services experience significant compliance and management benefits.
\par
The resource-based view suggests that the resources of a business are fundamental drivers of both performance and competitive advantage. Small accounting practitioners are therefore able to supply a range of competencies that could support SMEs' intangible resources and, hence, their competitive advantage.
\par
This article argues that the role of SAPs is to assist SMEs by offering financial management skills as well as managerial, strategic and operational know-how. It also argues that the frequency by which SMEs source different types of accounting services influences their perceptions of the benefits they obtain. This article contributes to the RBV theory by demonstrating which services provided by SAPs to SBOs contribute from a human capital resources perspective, and by advising SBOs on the types of services they should source from their SAPs to overcome any internal lack of financial and management skills.
\par
Traditional accounting services include bookkeeping, monthly reporting, year-end accounting services consisting of statutory and compliance services, as well as the completion and submission of tax returns. Advisory services include services that assist SBOs in managing the liquidity, profitability and growth of their businesses.
\par
This article proposes that the benefits that SBOs obtain from their relationship with their SAP are related to the types and frequency of services sourced from the SAP.
\par
The demand for traditional year-end accounting services is still mainly driven by regulatory requirements. However, when only basic bookkeeping and compliance services are sourced, clients do not obtain appropriate or adequate information to support planning, decision-making and control.
\par
Year-end financial reporting services are intended to provide small businesses with tax and audit compliance benefits, but very few management benefits. This is because the financial information prepared by accountants was never intended for internal decision-making purposes, and because the financial reports are outdated by the time they are presented.
\par
Although most studies indicate that small businesses derive little or no management benefit from traditional service offerings, some studies have nonetheless indicated that non-compliance may subject the SBO to severe emotional stress, result in penalties and fines, and put the organisation under financial pressure.
\par
Previous studies have established a relationship between accounting tasks and frequency of transactions. SBOs typically source traditional accounting services on a monthly or annual basis, and derive compliance benefits, but few management benefits.
\par
The role of accountants has developed over time from being a 'bean counter' to a role that comprises a much wider range of duties. Consequently, it is now commonly accepted that small businesses that source both compliance and advisory services from their accountants would obtain more benefits.
\par
Studies have hypothesized a positive relationship between business advice and financial performance, but the findings are mixed and inconclusive, leaving room for further investigation of the benefits derived from advisory services.
\par
In emerging economies, such as China and South Africa, the role of accountants is perceived to be narrower, with clients acknowledging only the core skill set of the accountants. This article will therefore test the hypothesis that SMEs that source advisory services perceive their relationship as more beneficial.
\par
This article used a cross-sectional, ex post facto design to study South African SBOs. It collected data using a convenient sampling method and emailed a questionnaire to a database of approximately 6000 SBOs.
\par
The sample population of the study comprised 32.2\% women and 67.8\% men, and the majority had a tertiary or professional qualification. The vast majority of the respondents had been in business for longer than 3.5 years.
\par
Twelve items measured the frequency by which SMEs source different accounting services from SAPs. A five-point direct rating scale was used to measure the frequency.
\par
The questionnaire included a list of benefits, with 1 representing strongly agree and 4 representing strongly disagree.
\par
A two-step approach was used to test the relationships between the frequency with which SMEs source different types of accounting services and their perceptions of benefits. The analysis used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and principal axis factoring (PAF) with Promax rotation.
\par
The underlying factor structure of the 12 items included for different types of services sourced was first assessed. Three items that had a low factor loading were eliminated from the analysis, and a three factor structure explaining 73\% of the variance in accounting services sourced was revealed.
\par
The factors loading onto factor 1 and 2 consist of routine accounting services, start-up advisory services, operational advisory services and strategic advisory services. The factor loading for factor 3 consists of year-end accounting services, but the factor loading for audit and independent review services is low.
\par
The underlying factor structure of the seven items included for the SBOs' perceptions of benefits obtained was assessed. Two factors, compliance benefits and management benefits, explained 77\% of the variance.
\par
This article assessed the individual relationships hypothesised in this article to ensure adequate model fit. The structural model demonstrated a good overall fit, with an adjusted goodness of fit index and confirmatory fit index of {$>$} 0.9.
\par
A positive relationship was found between the frequency of routine accounting services sourced by SBOs and management benefits received from the accounting practitioner.
\par
The frequency of non-routine accounting services sourced by SBOs and their perceptions of compliance benefits received from the accounting practitioner are related, but the frequency of advisory services sourced by SBOs is not related to their perceptions of compliance benefits received from the accounting practitioner.
\par
The frequency of sourcing advisory services by SBOs is positively related to their perceptions of management benefits received from their external accounting practitioners, and SMEs that source tax planning and routine accounting services receive significantly more compliance and management benefits.
\par
The frequency of accounting services used by SMEs affects the benefits obtained from their external accountants. The more frequently a firm uses its accountant, the more positive the perception.
\par
In line with expectations, the frequency by which SMEs source routine accounting services is related to their perceptions of compliance and management benefits obtained. Filing of income tax returns is also related to perceptions of compliance and management benefits obtained.
\par
The preparation and audit of financial statements is compulsory in most jurisdictions, including South Africa, and SMEs expect compliance benefits from sourcing these services. However, the researchers found no significant relationships between services relating to the preparation and audit of financial statements and management benefits received.
\par
The perception that filing income tax returns gives SBOs compliance benefits may be due to the harsh fines and penalties imposed by SARS on individuals and businesses that are found non-tax compliant.
\par
This article found that SMEs that source tax planning advice from their accountants perceive more compliance and management benefits than SMEs that do not source such services. However, most SMEs have never used advisory services, and this may explain why previous studies have reported mixed results.
\par
Previous research has indicated that sourcing compliance-related services may result in additional benefits, such as faster adaption to the environment. This article empirically supports this work.
\par
According to the RBV, accountants are seen to be excellently positioned to assist SMEs in overcoming the constraints resulting from inadequate internal financial management skills. This article shows that SMEs that source various types of services from their external accounting practitioner perceive benefits from these services.
\par
This article suggests that small business owners that lack financial management skills should consider sourcing additional services from their accountants to overcome any internal lack of financial and management skills. These services could help the small business owners overcome any difficulties associated with the lack of financial management skills.
\par
The findings of this study suggest that it is crucial for SMEs to transfer the skills they learn from their SAPs to their businesses, and that they source the right combination of services from their SAPs to secure long-term economic sustainability.
\par
This study suggests that SAPs have a value in the small business context, but caution should be applied when generalising the results to the entire population of SBOs in South Africa. There is an opportunity for future research to examine the relationship in an advanced economy.
\par
This article is based on the first author's thesis on the benefits small business owners obtain from their accounting practitioners.},

  abstract = {Non-compliance is a well-known issue in the field of cyber security. Non-compliance usually manifests in an individual's sins of omission or commission, and it is easy to conclude that the problem is attributable to their personal flawed decision making. However, the individual's decision not to comply is likely also to be influenced by a range of environmental and contextual factors. Bordieu, for example, suggests that personal habitus influences decisions. We identified a wide range of possible explanations for non-compliance from the research literature and classified these, finding that a number of the identified factors were indeed habitus related. We then used Q-methodology to determine which of these non-compliance explanations aligned with public attributions of non-compliance causatives. We discovered an ``attribution gulf'', with popular opinion attributing non-compliance primarily to individual failings or ignorance. The existence of this attribution gap means that those designing cyber security interventions are likely to neglect the influence of habitus on choices and decisions. We need to broaden our focus if non-compliance is to be reduced.},

This article discusses the two-party static game between market supervisory organization and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform, and solves the market equilibrium solutions based on income, cost, disguised cost, and fine, and income, cost, and reward.
\par
China's P2P lending platform has been running for more than ten years, and the government has made it a focus of supervision. Several regulatory policies have been issued and a series of regulatory measures have been introduced.
\par
P2P network lending platform has experienced many thunderstorms because of information asymmetry and moral hazard. To solve the problem, P2P network lending platform needs to build subsystems and stimulate these subsystems separately, synthesizing the loan, sharing the platform, P2P incentive, bank incentive, and so on. Perceived risk is important to reveal the moral hazard of the P2P lending platform, and physical capital variables, investors' perspective, and platform characteristic variables have a direct impact on perceived risk, but the impact of social environment on perceived risk is not significant.
\par
P2P lending platform is widely used in supply chain finance. By combining data from large P2P lending platforms with data from popular social media websites, the default probability of borrowers can be predicted.
\par
The Internet-enabled P2P lending system has become a disruptive technology that has impacted financial services, business capitalization strategies, and personal and community development. However, the probability of default is high in P2P lending platforms, and lenders are very concerned about predicting whether borrowers will be default on repayments.
\par
This paper considers two kinds of supervision methods for market supervision, namely "strong supervision" and "weak supervision", and two different operation modes of compliance management and noncompliance management in P2P platform. It also analyzes the various related behavioral factors of the supervision organizations and the P2P lending platforms.
\par
This paper studies the relationship between market supervision and P2P platforms and the equilibrium solution for four game modes: strong supervision, compliance management, strong supervision, noncompliance management, and strong supervision, noncompliance management.
\par
The premise of this paper is that if a P2P platform chooses to operate in compliance, it will earn R1, and if it chooses to operate in noncompliance, it will earn R2. The unit operating cost is C1, and the moral hazard cost is C4.
\par
Under strong supervision, a noncompliant P2P platform will be exposed and punished, and the profit of the negative exposure of the P2P platform by the supervision organization is R3.
\par
The supervision organization can choose to punish the P2P platform that chooses noncompliant operations, or it can choose to encourage the P2P platform to choose compliant operations. The supervision organization's intention is to choose weak supervision.
\par
When the supervision organization conducts strong supervision, the P2P platform benefits from normal revenue, the audit cost of compliance, and the incentive issued by the supervision organization. When the supervision organization conducts weak supervision, the P2P platform benefits from rebates, the audit cost, and the incentive issued by the supervision organization.
\par
The supervision organization expects a return of 1 if the P2P online lending platform selection compliance operation is performed according to the payment matrix Table 1.
\par
The P2P lending platform does not want the supervision organization to make its own decisions about market supervision, so it follows the principle of no arbitrage in the equilibrium state.
\par
If the P2P lending platform chooses the probability of compliance management, it actually chooses noncompliant operations. If the difference between strong supervision cost and weak supervision cost is less than (AL + E)/L, the supervision organization chooses strong supervision; if the difference is greater than (AL + E)/L, the supervision organization chooses weak supervision; if the difference is equal to AL + E, the supervision organization chooses weak supervision.
\par
The expected return of a P2P lending platform to select strong supervision is calculated based on a static game.
\par
The supervision organization does not want to guess what kind of supervisory strategies the P2P lending platform will choose, so they are not interested in discovering the platforms' decisions.
\par
The P2P online lending platform chooses to operate in compliance under equilibrium, and the supervision organization chooses strong supervision.
\par
If the supervision organization chooses a probability of strong supervision, the P2P lending platform will choose noncompliant operations when the supervision organization conducts weak supervision.
\par
When the supervision organization's reward for the P2P lending platform exceeds R2 + R3 AL C4L, the P2P lending platform will choose to operate in compliance; when the supervision organization's reward is less than R2 + R3 AL C4L, the P2P lending platform will choose noncompliant operations.
\par
Five variables affect the probability of the P2P platform choosing a compliance strategy in an equilibrium state.
\par
The relationship between the equilibrium state and the unit penalty paid by the P2P lending platform after detection by the supervision organization is monotonously increasing. When the unit penalty increases, the P2P lending platform may evade the fine and increase its expected return.
\par
When the unit cost of weak supervision increases, the probability of a P2P lending platform choosing a compliance management strategy increases, which is conducive to the development of the industry.
\par
When the incentive for the P2P lending platform to operate in compliance increases, the probability of selecting the compliance operation strategy increases, and so does the probability of the supervision organization increasing the incentive.
\par
The relationship between the equilibrium state and the market size is monotonously decreasing, and the larger the market is, the lower the probability that a P2P lending platform will choose a compliant business strategy.
\par
The supervision organization chooses the probability of strong supervision when the equilibrium state is reached.
\par
The relationship between the equilibrium state of a P2P lending platform and the unit cost of compliance management is monotonously increasing, and the relationship between the equilibrium state of a P2P lending platform and the unit cost of noncompliant management is monotonously decreasing.
\par
When the extra income obtained by the platform due to noncompliance increases, the probability of the supervision organization performing strong supervision increases, because this kind of income is abnormal and can affect the financial order.
\par
When the number of unit fines imposed by the supervision organization on a P2P lending platform increases, the probability of the supervision organization conducting strong supervision decreases, and the probability of the supervision organization conducting strong supervision increases when the number of P2P lending platforms increases.
\par
The relationship between the equilibrium state q and the incentive issued by the supervision organization is monotonously decreasing, and the probability of adopting weak supervision will increase.
\par
In 2018, Guangdong Province ranked first in the number of P2P lending platforms in China, and ranked among the top three in terms of online loan balance. The total platform size of Guangdong Province was 640, and the total transaction volume was 270 billion.
\par
The impact of the unit cost of strong supervision on the probability of platform selection compliance operation is analyzed. The probability of platform selection compliance operation decreases when the unit cost of strong supervision is increased.
\par
The probability of a platform selecting a compliance management strategy depends on the incentive given by the supervision organization, the market size of the platform, and the unit cost of strong supervision.
\par
We can calculate the probability of compliance management for different market sizes by varying the incentive structure, penalty after exposure of non-compliant operation, and supervision institution strength. The probability of compliance management for different market sizes is monotonously decreasing.
\par
The influence of camouflage costs (C4) and incentives (E) on the probability of strong supervision by supervisory organizations is analyzed.
\par
Figure 4 shows that when a P2P lending platform chooses to operate non-compliantly, the probability of strong supervision will decrease.
\par
When the platform increases the additional income due to noncompliance, the probability of strong supervision by the supervision organization increases, and when the platform decreases the additional income due to noncompliance, the probability of strong supervision by the supervision organization decreases.
\par
The probability that a supervision organization will conduct strong supervision depends on the size of the entire P2P market and the number of unit fines imposed by the supervision organization on the P2P lending platform.
\par
The more incentives the government gives to promote competition within the industry, the more likely the supervision policies tend to be supervised through market regulation and platform self-discipline.
\par
In 2015, China issued several policies to strengthen supervision of P2P lending platforms. We use game theory to analyze the relationship between supervision policies and platform behavior.
\par
In the equilibrium state, the P2P lending platform chooses compliance management with a probability of p and the supervision organization chooses strong supervision with a probability of q. If the supervision organization chooses weak supervision, the P2P lending platform will choose noncompliant management. If the supervision organization chooses strong supervision, the P2P lending platform will choose compliant management. When the unit fine paid by noncompliant P2P lending platforms increases, the probability of P2P lending platforms choosing compliance management increases, and the probability of the supervision organization choosing strong supervision decreases. When the scale of the P2P industry platform increases, the supervision organization will prefer to adopt weak supervision.},

\par
Numerous studies investigate the application of process mining in governance, risk management, compliance, and auditing in response to changing business processes brought about by digital transformation. The study identifies 6 phases and 32 concrete steps or activities as components of the application of process mining.
\par
Digital transformation through technological convergence brings fundamental changes to organizations. Digital transformation requires better governance processes, more effective risk management and compliance programs, and process mining (PM) can be used in GRC to ensure the validity and reliability of organizational business processes.
\par
PM for audit within the GRC framework is a rapidly research topic along with changes in organizational business processes. Several studies have investigated the use of PM for audits, and anomaly and fraud detection within the GRC framework.
\par
This study uses the systematic literature review to answer several research questions about PM in GRC and auditing. It also contributes to the development of PM science by defining the components and sub-components of PM frameworks in GRC and auditing.
\par
This paper describes the background and motivations for the research, discusses the literature review, and offers conclusions and suggestions for future research.
\par
Process mining is the intersection between data mining and business process management. It consists of process discovery, conformance checking, and performance measurement.
\par
Process mining is a method for diagnosing processes by mining even-logs for knowledge. It consists of 6 phases: planning, data extraction, data processing, mining \& analysis, evaluation, and process improvement \& support.
\par
GRC and auditing refer to organizational capabilities to achieve their objectives effectively by managing uncertainties and acting with full integrity. PM has been an auditors' useful tool to generate more knowledge about actual business processes that helps auditors assess risks better.
\par
SLR consists of defining research scope, searching for relevant papers, screening papers, combining papers based on keywords in the abstracts, extracting data, and mapping results to answer research questions.
\par
Based on the research objectives, we propose the following research questions.
\par
The most crucial stage is screening of papers based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The papers must be electronically available and found by the search strings in all fields and periods, at least reviewed by two journal or conference reviewers, and published online from 2000 to February 2020.
\par
This stage extracts data from paper contents based on the research questions and objectives.
\par
The results of the SLR are discussed in the form of types of research (review or research paper), research area or domain, and results.
\par
A total of 34 papers were selected from 8 scientific article databases based on the search strings and selection criteria. These 34 papers were then extracted to answer research questions.
\par
This paper discusses 26 papers discussing the framework and stages of using PM, and then identifies relevant components and sub-components in accordance with the stages in the PM2 method.
\par
The results of the research show that there have been 22 studies published in the form of journal articles and 12 others at conferences on GRC and auditing. Furthermore, 29 articles were empirical research articles with various approaches, models, datasets and especially the PM framework on GRC and auditing.
\par
The most prolific author of 34 selected papers is Mieke Jans, with a total of 64 papers published. Jans' terminology is Business Process Mining and Werner's terminology is Multilevel Process Mining for Financial Audits.
\par
The research domain of PM on GRC and auditing is related to finance. However, PM has also begun to be used in the manufacturing domain to ensure governance and risks in the production process.
\par
PM2 is a method that consists of 6 stages, namely Planning, Extraction, Data Processing, Mining \& Analysis, Evaluation, and Process Improvement \& Support.
\par
The 6 components and 32 subcomponents identified from the selected paper are: planning, extraction, data processing, mining and analysis, evaluation, process improvement and support. The output of the evaluation stage is the idea for improvement that achieves the project objectives.
\par
The results of this research are particularly useful for mapping the components and sub-components of the PM method in GRC and auditing. This research opens up opportunities for continuous research and development of special algorithms that match the character of GRC and auditing.
\par
The results of the study have mapped the components and sub-components of PM on GRC and auditing using the stages of the PM2 method, and have identified the most productive authors and research objectives using PM in GRC and auditing.
\par
The main result of this research is to structure the various stages in the PM method so that components and sub-components can be categorized. The results can be used for the development and implementation of PM, especially in the context of GRC and auditing.

The compliance management process will not be efficient unless it manages to show evidences of explicit verification of legal requirements. In order to achieve this goal, privacy compliance should be addressed through ``a privacy by design'' approach. This paper presents an approach to privacy protection verification by means of a novel audit framework. It aims to allow privacy auditors to look at past events of data processing effectuated by healthcare organisation and verify compliance to legal privacy requirements. The adapted approach used semantic modelling and a semantic reasoning layer that could be placed on top of hospital databases. These models allow the integration of fine-grained context information about the sharing of patient data and provide an explicit capturing of applicable privacy obligation. This is particularly helpful for insuring a seamless data access logging and an effective compliance checking during audit trials.},

\par
In order to comply with privacy in multi-jurisdictional health domains, a privacy by design approach should be used. This approach allows privacy auditors to look at past events of data processing effectuated by healthcare organisations and verify compliance to legal privacy requirements.
\par
Privacy protection in geographically distributed healthcare and medical research systems is subject to policies dictated by conflicting jurisdictions and legislations. To enhance social acceptance, better privacy assurance mechanisms are needed that allow patients to benefit from enhanced healthcare strategies and better medical research outcome while having less concerns about their privacy. In healthcare computer applications, the risk of breaching patient privacy continues to exist, particularly due to the usage of exception-based access to data and the exposure of the systems to Internet and cyber security risks. Hence, audit and governance mechanisms are highly required.
\par
The paper presents a compliance framework for healthcare privacy, which is structured as follows: section 2, section 3, section 4, section 5, section 6, and section 7.
\par
Privacy is a high priority for compliance, especially for disciplines that rely on the processing of personal data to achieve success. The EU 95/46/EC Directive was published in 1995, and the General Data Protection Regulation came into force in May 2018.
\par
Major digital transformation in healthcare has led to the use of sensitive data such as medical health records, medical images, or even information about patient lifestyle, which could be shared through cloud services. A lack of strong mechanisms to enforce privacy requirements has led to the NHS using large separated networks.
\par
We believe that an effective way to contribute to data governance and privacy compliance in our context is by integrating business strategies with automated processes responsible for specifying and managing organizational policies. However, reaching a parallelism between organizational high-level policies and its operational processes is still a challenge.
\par
Hippocratic Databases compliance auditing allows enterprises to log information about past queries in the form of metadata constituting a database log. This approach allows auditors to track past data usage attempts by relying on the query log, but it does not incorporate mechanisms to automatically evaluate the handling of specific, fine-grained legal requirements.
\par
In relation with semantic policy-based compliance checking, the work in [4, 22, 46] provides a solution to some aspect of compliance auditing. It uses fuzzy sets theory to deal with limitations of SWRL and uses compliant process models and compliance patterns to detect and resolve non-compliant processes.
\par
In previous studies we have shown how to classify resources that we would like to protect, and how to share the resources using a privacy and data protection ontology. In this paper we show how to make healthcare IT systems more self-disciplined and trustworthy by integrating a privacy audit dimension.
\par
Our previous work has produced models of data sharing along with abilities to generate and record legal requirements for privacy protection. In this paper, we are taking this work further by including an automated framework allowing auditors to test for compliance between heterogeneous domain's high-level policies and their enforced privacy preserving controls.
\par
The system checks if a compliant case was in place at the time the actual sharing was authorised, and reports a compliant data sharing to the auditor.
\par
We aim to use an ontology to log past data sharing events. This will allow real time usage.
\par
We describe a compliance checking framework for sharing data between nodes of a European Health Grid infrastructure, where the data is shared between two nodes for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment. The secondary purpose must be compatible with the original purpose of collection.
\par
The logging task is triggered by an access control system obligation and consists of the context of the access control request and the access control response for all the past data access and disclosure that have been allowed by the system.
\par
We have designed semantic web rules that comply with the European law on privacy and data protection, by explicitly translating high-level natural language (English) policies interpreted from text law. These rules are recorded in an ontology as properties of the specific case of sharing where its information is given as facts to the rule engine. Through the use of policy-based approaches, we can only check if the data has been anonymised before it could be sent. We cannot guarantee that the data has been anonymised.
\par
We use a rule-based approach to check for compliance with legal requirements at the time of requesting a data access. The rule engine adds an axiom testing for the satisfaction of the legal requirement to the data-sharing event being audited.
\par
We associate an OWL axiom with the property consent(DataSharing, Boolean literal) for testing whether the requirement was satisfied.
\par
The SWRL rule model follows the compliance rule template described above and checks whether the requirement of consent necessity for a specific data sharing was satisfied before allowing it to happen in the past.
\par
OWL is governed by an Open World Assumption, so the absence of a tester axiom does not necessarily mean that the requirement was not satisfied. Hence, we need to close the Open World Assumption through other means.
\par
The engine assumes that the tester clause was not found among the semantics describing the data Sharing context, and sets the requirement satisfaction property to non-satisfied.
\par
The compliance management framework contains a privacy compliance audit component, a legal requirements generator component, and a requirements satisfaction checker component. The legal requirements generator component generates a set of legal requirements for a specified event of data sharing, and the requirements satisfaction checker component checks whether these requirements were satisfied.
\par
In this section we present a use-case scenario built on the illustration scenario presented earlier. We consider a set of compliant accesses and also few failures cases, and we show the outcome of the proposed system for a specified set of accessed data and for another context information.
\par
The SWRL rule presents the scenario described above and states that sharing a mammogram is allowed if the patient consent was originally given for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment purposes.
\par
We present a rule for inferring legal requirements for sharing or sending UK patient data.
\par
The auditor can generate an audit report about a selected sharing from the audit backlog. The report includes all legal requirements for the audited context of sharing.
\par
The auditor notices that some legal requirements have not been satisfied, however, the access control system decided to allow the sharing of the data. If the non-satisfied requirements are of type non-enforceable, the hospital will need to show other proofs of compliance.
\par
Two legal requirements were identified in the audit report for sharing2: consent-for-primary-purpose and secondary-purpose-compatibility. Both requirements were satisfied by the data sharing requestor, and the audit report indicated that the data sharing was compliant.
\par
We used SWRL rules to specify a privacy aware access control system, a privacy requirements generation system, and a privacy audit system. These rules were executed using the JESS rule engine plugged in Prot\'eg\'e 3.4 platform.
\par
Our work does not provide a complete automation of the process of privacy compliance audit because we believe a human intervention is always necessary to investigate cases such as checking for compliance with non-enforceable requirements. Besides, exposing private data about users of the system might raise some privacy preserving concerns.
\par
The authors reviewed the existing works on privacy management in healthcare, and proposed an audit mechanism that tests for compliance with explicitly specified requirements dictated by regulations. However, the model of logged data needs to be optimised, and high level policies are by nature mutable and dynamic.
\par
In this paper, we have introduced a framework for privacy compliance checking in healthcare heterogeneous domains such as eHealth Cloud systems. This framework allows proactive verification adherence to requirements dictated by high level legal and ethical policies.},

  abstract = {In an agricultural supply chain, farmers, food processors, transportation agencies, importers, and exporters must comply with different regulations imposed by one or more jurisdictions depending on the nature of their business operations. Supply chain stakeholders conventionally transport their goods, along with the corresponding documentation via regulators for compliance checks. This is generally followed by a tedious and manual process to ensure the goods meet regulatory requirements. However, supply chain systems are changing through digitization. In digitized supply chains, data is shared with the relevant stakeholders through digital supply chain platforms, including blockchain technology. In such datadriven digital supply chains, the regulators may be able to leverage digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to automate the compliance verification process. However, a barrier to progress is the risk that information will not be credible, thus reversing the gains that automation could achieve. Automating compliance based on inaccurate data may compromise the safety and credibility of the agricultural supply chain, which discourages regulators and other stakeholders from adopting and relying on automation. Within this article we consider the challenges of digital supply chains when we describe parts of the compliance management process and how it can be automated to improve the operational efficiency of agricultural supply chains. We introduce assisted autonomy as a means to pragmatically automate the compliance verification process by combining the power of digital systems while keeping the human in-the-loop. We argue that autonomous compliance is possible, but that the need for human led inspection processes will never be replaced by machines, however it can be minimised through 'assisted autonomy'. \textcopyright{} 2021 IEEE.},

\par
In an agricultural supply chain, stakeholders must comply with different regulations imposed by one or more jurisdictions depending on the nature of their business operations. Digital supply chain platforms, including blockchain technology, may automate compliance verification, but inaccurate data may compromise safety and credibility.
\par
We consider the challenges of digital supply chains and how to automate the compliance management process. We introduce "assisted autonomy" to minimise human led inspection processes.
\par
In agricultural supply chains, farmers and producers must comply with a vast array of regulations. Digital systems enable stakeholders to easily share and exchange product and payment information, reducing the need for paper-based documents and manual intervention in the verification process.
\par
In a digital system, stakeholders provide information about a product's origin, production process, health certificate, food label, manufacturer's declaration, and import certificate. However, one of the supply chain entities may intentionally (or accidentally) enter incorrect or false information into the digital system.
\par
The paper discusses the compliance management process for the agricultural supply chain using cheese imported in Australia as an exemplar. It also proposes an assisted autonomy framework for automated compliance management.
\par
The producers and processors of food in an agri-food supply chain must follow directives imposed by various regulatory bodies. The regulators in the country of consumption may also inspect the food items at the time of exportation.
\par
In a cross-border supply chain, regulators at the source country must ensure the food producer holds the appropriate license and complies with the safety and bio-security directives of the source country. The destination country must inspect the food items to ensure compliance with its regulations.
\par
Food safety regulations may overlap in different ways, which makes it more difficult to access certain markets in one country than another. The World Trade Organization negotiated and adopted rules to reduce trade barriers.
\par
The Codex Alimentarius Commission develops international food safety standards, and the WTO encourages members to adopt these standards to harmonise import and export requirements. The TBT Agreement does not identify any specific standards, but may facilitate supply chain digitisation.
\par
Although organizations such as the WTO and Codex promote harmonized rules, each country may have unique customs and biosecurity requirements.
\par
Digital globalisation means that trade is becoming more complex and that regulatory requirements impose costs beyond that which was the case even 25 years ago. However, digitisation of supply chains will improve efficiency in international trade.
\par
Blockchain-based digital supply chains are emerging, which aim to improve efficiency in transactions, improve transparency and regulatory compliance.
\par
In Australia, a trial of blockchain in trade was concluded with Singapore in August 2021. The trial involved the use of QR codes and was a success, enabling immediate verification for authenticity and integrity of the document.
\par
Digital technology may be used to enhance efficiency and improve compliance in international trade. However, there are no WTO agreements that harmonise cross border data flows, data storage or privacy requirements.
\par
The existing regulatory environment for agri-food supply chains involves multiple jurisdictions with complex and heterogeneous regulations. Risk and trust are key indicators for deciding the level of inspections needed for agri-food consignment.
\par
A framework for automated compliance management helps regulators make an informed decision during the compliance management process. The framework uses the risk profile of food and the trust of the firm, product, and country to determine the level of inspections needed.
\par
The process of importing cheese into Australia can be confusing initially.
\par
A COO or DOO is a form of self-certification and must be valid for one year. A DOO may be accepted instead of a COO for goods covered by an advance ruling.
\par
A health certificate must be presented with imported goods with the following statements: - Species of origin - Disease status of country of origin - Health of animals at the time of milk production - Disease status of the country of manufacture - Date of manufacture - Heat treatment status - Food labelling standards .
\par
Importers can apply for an exemption to an inspection through the Food Import Compliance Agreements (FICA), but the inspection process is time consuming and costly for the importer and the destination country regulators. This paper proposes an approach that leverages emerging technologies such as blockchain and AI.
\par
During the compliance verification process, regulators inspect consignments and verify the information provided in the document. Incorrect information could delay the supply chain processes or lead to a product ban.
\par
In an agri-food supply chain, sensitive information of food producers may not be openly available to competitors. A privacy-preserving system is needed.
\par
The regulators of agri-food supply chains can assess the credibility of the products and the relevant stakeholders through a reputation mechanism. The regulators may focus more on the producers of the products rather than the country of origin.
\par
When importing or exporting agri-food products, producers must comply with the safety requirements of the relevant country whose market they wish to access. Regulators apply different criteria for different food products and classify imported agri-food in several categories based on their risk profile.
\par
Cross-border supply chains involve heterogeneous regulatory environments, and a one-size-fits-all approach will not work. A versatile digital framework is required.
\par
The proposed assisted autonomy framework assumes that regulatory documents would be converted into digital data and that certification documents would be presented as evidence.
\par
The distributed ledger and the blockchain technology provide a decentralized infrastructure for multi-stakeholder applications. It uses a distributed consensus protocol to enable stakeholders to exchange digital information through secure middleware.
\par
Blockchain technology enables application developers to build solutions using smart contracts, which can execute business processes in a decentralized infrastructure, offering transparency and trust guarantees to the concerned stakeholders.
\par
The proposed assisted autonomy framework focuses on compliance management.
\par
The framework in Figure 5 focuses on assisted autonomy involving both computer processes and humans. Smart contracts enable regulators to translate legislative rules into software, and the outcome of the compliance verification process depends on the correctness of the digital information.
\par
To automate compliance management, the system needs to establish identities for the agri-food stakeholders. These identities can be tracked by regulators using smart contracts and ACL.
\par
A reputation system could be used to vet the organizations involved in the trading process, and to track the reputation of the agri-food stakeholders. This would allow regulators to decide on the extensiveness of consignment validation, and encourage producers to behave honestly.
\par
In a blockchain-based supply chain, consent management is needed to manage access control policies. Smart contracts could be used to get consent from the relevant stakeholders and let the data owners know who accesses the data for what purposes.
\par
The assisted autonomy framework uses Oracle to access off-chain data and services, such as AI-based risk assessment, license validation, and metric and currency conversion, during the regulatory process. This helps the blockchain smart contracts to access off-chain data and services through a trusted mechanism.
\par
We want to automate compliance verification to help producers and regulators trust digital supply chains.
\par
Blockchain technology can't distinguish between false data and accurate data, so malicious supply chain operators can record incorrect information. Physical inspections increase the probability of detecting products that fail to satisfy the regulatory information requirements, and automation can help reduce food fraud.
\par
Supply chain applications to support cross-border trade will likely involve multiple countries, and may require multiple documents and certificates to complete the compliance checks. Harmonizing regulatory requirements may simplify the compliance verification process and improve market access.
\par
This paper presents a framework for automation of the compliance verification process for agri-food supply chains using blockchain, IoT, and machine learning. Accurate digital information is identified as one of the critical requirements to improve regulators' confidence in adopting automation for compliance.},

This article talks about some of the issues related to Predictive Compliance Management, which is directly related to the S\'EAC project, as this is pretty much what we are trying to achieve.

\par
Business process compliance can be checked during process design time based on verification of process models and at runtime based on monitoring the compliance states of running process instances. Predictions of compliance violations are crucial in order to prepare and take countermeasures in time.
\par
Online and predictive data analysis capabilities are immense as historical data may no longer be relevant. PPM approaches promise to predict violations of Service Level Agreements and process compliance constraints.
\par
Predictive Compliance Monitoring (PCM) is a vital part of digitalized compliance management and monitoring. It addresses online settings and predicts compliance violations of process instances during runtime.
\par
The EU has issued several regulations for public health, which are refined and implemented by the member states. These regulations have a significant impact on processes at airports, and the lack of approaches for continuous monitoring of compliance with regulations might result in severe threats to passenger safety.
\par
Linear Temporal Logic or Event Calculus is used to determine the set of compliance violations, the probability with which the violation will occur, the actual or predicted time the violation will/has occurred, and the root cause of the violation.
\par
The process control monitoring problem takes as input a process event log or stream and a set of compliance constraints. The compliance constraints refer to basic or complex control flow patterns and additional process perspectives, e.g., time, data, and resources.
\par
The probability of a violation of c at step 1 is 23 because we can just have B in step 2 causing no violation of c.
\par
We consider the prediction model to be trained on historical data and do not update the probabilities of violations as new observations arrive.
\par
This paper considers the overall method to tackle RQ1 - RQ4. It starts with a compilation and analysis of PCM literature, then analyzes CM literature, then analyzes PPM literature for papers with possible PCM focus, and analyzes CM case studies for further CM functionalities.
\par
This paper presents an extended CM Functionality Framework, a "wish list" of CM Functionalities to be predicted, a systematic analysis of existing (mostly PPM) approaches along this wish list, and finally open challenges and research directions for PCM.
\par
We started with a literature compilation for process control management using GoogleScholar, and selected keywords based on title and abstract.
\par
We searched for literature covering PCM, combined with expert knowledge, and identified three research areas that coincide with PCM, i.e. CM, PPM, and SLA prediction. We compiled 167 papers in total, including 13 surveys.
\par
The compilation includes papers from the following domains: compliance and business process management, manufacturing, information security, cloud computing, and service compositions. Out of these, 3 can be classified as PPM or SLA prediction approaches.
\par
Table 2 depicts the results of the literature compilation on CM. It is distinguished into 16 papers after 2015 (without SLA), 8 SLA papers (before and after 2015), and 2 compliance monitoring functionality surveys, including [64].
\par
This paper presents the results of a literature search for PPM. It identifies 9 papers that address compliance in connection with PPM, out of which 3 address constraint definition through SLA and 2 address constraint definition in the form of predicates.
\par
Out of 49 initial hits, 11 papers are selected based on their title and focus on computer science. These 11 papers are merged with results from the literature compilations on PCM, CM, and PPM.
\par
The overall goal of this paper is to assess whether and to which extent existing approaches to compliance monitoring address predictive compliance monitoring and to identify research gaps.
\par
The compliance constraints model (CMF) refers to the control flow of a process.
\par
The CMFs describe the execution requirements for process instances, while CMF7 - 10 describe the user requirements for support to understand and handle compliance violations. CMF8 refers to proactive compliance management, and PCM requires the prediction of compliance violations.
\par
The CM literature compilation contains 16 papers after 2015, which (at least partly) address one or several of the CMFs of the original framework in [64]. These papers address the requirements in [64], [6, 5, 90], [19], and [4] in addition to the requirements in [64].
\par
bpCMon [36] addresses multiple process perspectives, [39] extends ECA rules with Time (TECA), [55] addresses CMF1 - CMF3, [57] addresses CMF4 - CMF6 as well as [58] addresses CMF9.
\par
[62] tackle distributed compliance monitoring, [68] tackle multiperspective DECLARE constraints, [73] tackle artifact-based monitoring, [99] tackle general requirements and challenges, and [106] tackle security constraints.
\par
The paper addresses CMF5 as well as CMF3 (separation of duty constraints) and is implemented with DROOLS. The paper provides too few details on the conceptual model/design of the approach, thereby making further assessment of CMF coverage hard.
\par
CMF1 - CMF10 as proposed in [64] are still valid, but new directions/requirements are outlined in Sect. 3.5.
\par
[23] discuss the PPM perspectives control flow, time, data, and resources. Control flow is implicitly assumed in the original CMF framework, but a dedicated CMF for control flow is added in the context of existing approaches for PPM that mainly refer to SLAs.
\par
[21, 11] mention the requirement to consider external (process) context data. [41, 87] combine process simulation with prediction, and [98, 9, 71, 86, 95] advocate updating the set of possible/future violations when new events occur during runtime.
\par
A collection of papers on PPM address the properties and quality of the input data.
\par
A new requirement on compliance constraints will be added to the CMF framework, and CMF8 and CMF9 will be refined.
\par
[20, 44] mention prediction across multiple process cases, but do not provide any solutions. They use an abstract notation for service orchestrations, and predict possible situations of SLA conformance and violation.
\par
Several approaches to predict service level agreements and adapt service compositions in order to avoid a violation of service level agreements are presented.
\par
We analyze case studies and real-world compliance constraint collections to derive extensions of the CMF framework. These extensions can be used to model concurrent, constrained, ordered, non-concurrent, and constrained start of following instances.
\par
The extended CMF framework is based on the control flow patterns for compliance constraints. It is partitioned into sub CMFs reflecting specific requirements on the expressiveness of the CMF.
\par
The extensions to CMF6 cover multiple instance constraints, constrained execution of tasks across process instances/processes, constrained start of following instances, and explainability of prediction results and mitigation actions.
\par
We analyze the extended framework for PCM and provide the prediction requirements for each CMF, resulting in a PCM wish list.
\par
Modeling requirements are expressed as control flow, time, data, and resource constraints. Control flow can be expressed as either qualitative or quantitative, and time can be expressed as unary or extended.
\par
CMF 1.2 time quantitative, CMF 2.1 activity data (unary+extended), CMF 2.2 time (unary+extended) predict set of next activities / events, ranked by probability of occurrence, plus 
\par
CMF4 - CMF6.5 relate to the support of non-atomic activities and the support of activity life cycles. CMF6.1 - CMF6.5 refer to multiple instance constraints.
\par
Compliance prediction for execution CMFs requires approaches to distinguish between different event types and predict different event types and life cycle states.
\par
CMF7 is not relevant for predictive process and compliance monitoring. CMF8 and CMF9 are.
\par
CMF 8.1 detects conflicts among rules as soon as possible with precise probability/likelihood; continuously updates set of conflicting rules as event stream evolves.
\par
CMF 8.2 possible/future violations. Example: For a concrete payment run with amount beyond 10,000e, the monitoring system can deduce that two activities (namely sign the payment list and file the payment list) are pending and need to be executed to comply.
\par
CMF 8.4 provides mitigation actions for users to avoid violations. CMF 9.1 provides root cause analysis for single and multiple instances.
\par
CMF 9.3 explain and visualize prediction results, CMF 9.4 explain and visualize set of possible/future violations, CMF 9.5 explain and visualize effects of mitigation actions, and CMF 9.6 explain and visualize root cause representation.
\par
A passenger ship leaving Amsterdam has to moor in Newcastle within 16 hours. It is desirable to judge different ships with different degrees of violation.
\par
Wish list for user requirement prediction: Continuous prediction of conflicting compliance constraints and compliance violations, visualization of predicted compliance violations and their probabilities, root cause analysis of predicted compliance violations, and mitigation actions.
\par
Integration of data from multiple sources, distributed processes, and context data are required for prediction of compliance with process and data integrity constraints. Predictions should be based on activity semantics and attribute equivalence.
\par
The dataset only provides 787 instances for 331 possible activities, resulting in a high sparsity of 0.42. This makes it difficult to predict compliance with data requirements, especially for online predictions and in the presence of a multitude of compliance constraints and event data.
\par
Based on the extended CMF framework presented in Section 3 and the prediction requirements presented in Section 4, we assess the coverage of existing approaches to predict process change management (PCM) based on observed process behavior. Our results show that existing approaches support some CMFs, partially or fully.
\par
We identified 43 papers that describe PPM approaches for predicting the next activity or event.
\par
For PCM, next activity / event prediction means to make statements about upcoming activities / events that are referred in one or several compliance constraints. The output of existing approaches is often not entirely clear.
\par
For PCM, the prediction requirements state to predict the set of next activities / events, ranked by probability of occurrence and a distinction between immediately/eventually occurs. The approaches provide fine-granular prediction feedback with probabilities, but none explicitly provide data values.
\par
Existing approaches to compliance monitoring for process instances and processes do not consider next activity/event prediction across several instances/processes for order (CMF6.3) and non-concurrent execution (CMF6.4). In addition, existing approaches do not provide mitigation actions/recommendations for compliance violations (CMF8.4).
\par
Root cause analysis can be implicitly based on probabilities and feature vectors, but communication of root causes to users is missing. Several approaches are targeting explainability of prediction results, predicted violations, and effects of mitigation actions.
\par
Several approaches consider contextual data for next activity/event prediction. The influence of external contextual data such as sensor streams has not been investigated yet.
\par
We categorized 60 papers dealing with any kind of temporal prediction. We will comment on this within the respective category.
\par
Existing approaches for quantitative time prediction use transition systems and next activity / event prediction approaches, but do not predict temporal activity and case data.
\par
Resource prediction is mostly seen from a scheduling perspective, while other approaches use resources as features for temporal prediction. CMF4 and CMF5 are not covered (), and CMF6.2 - 6.4 are not covered by temporal prediction approaches ().
\par
Root cause analysis can be prepared based on approaches such as [45], [7], [53], and [93] that explain the influence of attributes on the prediction results. Several approaches to temporal prediction are missing, and none of them exploit external context data.
\par
26 approaches are categorized as outcome prediction approaches, and some 'AnyIndicator' approaches are related to outcome prediction. Some 'AnyIndicator' approaches exploit life cycle information in the event logs/streams, but none address CMF6.2 on constrained execution or processes.
\par
Prescriptive monitoring approaches can foster the early detection of compliance violations and the preparation of mitigation actions. However, they do not provide recommendations or mitigation actions for CMF9.1 - 9.4 and do not address CMF10.1 - 10.2.
\par
We identified 2 approaches that predict possible violations of predicates, ranging from simple SLA [59] to LTL based formulae [67]. These approaches do not provide updates of the predictions, visualizations, root cause analysis, and mitigation actions.
\par
3 papers deal with cost or risk prediction. The approaches differ in that the approaches focus on activity data (CMF2.1), risk parameters (CMF3.1 and CMF3.2), and risk aggregation over multiple instances (CMF6.2).
\par
This section discusses existing PPM approaches and their potential for comprehensive PCM support.
\par
Existing PPM approaches cover observed behavior for compliance constraints, but unseen behavior is largely uncovered. In combination with compliance constraints, the requirement to predict unseen behavior becomes even more likely.
\par
In PPM, time and resources are predicted, but data values are not predicted. Prediction of data values might be of great interest for constraints that refer to certain thresholds in medicine, logistics, and manufacturing.
\par
None of the existing PPM approaches exploits the life cycle of activities, but these life cycle states might indicate exceptional behavior, requiring mitigation actions.
\par
Existing approaches to predict compliance of constraints that span multiple process instances and/or multiple processes are limited.
\par
Some approaches suggest mitigation actions to overcome compliance violations, but none provide estimations on their significance.
\par
First approaches to addressing data requirements in PPM and PCM are missing, and contextual data is promising, but under-researched.
\par
First approaches for predicting compliance degrees across multiple process instances were presented. However, the challenge remains how to update compliance violations.
\par
Several strategies are proposed for updating a prediction model when unseen process behavior occurs, including updating the model whenever unseen behavior occurs, as well as predicting unseen behavior as such.
\par
Unseen tasks in compliance constraints are treated differently depending on whether they are fully or partly violated. In the example, a task that has not been observed for a given compliance constraint is treated differently depending on whether it is partially or fully violated.
\par
Compliance constraint c3 is possibly violated and c4 possibly satisfied for all process instances. For c5, c7, c6 and c8, A triggers the nonoccurrence of F, which is possibly satisfied for this case.
\par
If a task is observed and no end event has been observed yet, the compliance state of constraint c3 is updated from possibly violated to satisfied, and the state of constraint c4 is updated from satisfied to violated.
\par
Knowledge that a compliance constraint refers to a behavior (e.g., c3) is exploited for prediction. This can support the prediction that some unseen behavior might occur.
\par
PPM and PCM have not dealt with unseen behavior, data, or resources yet. This necessitates update strategies of prediction models and the continuous update of the violations predictions.
\par
Data prediction approaches are missing for compliance constraints. However, predicting data values is crucial for a transportation process if the transportation takes up to 5 hours, or longer if the transportation takes longer than 5 hours.
\par
Continuous update of prediction results is needed for compliance violations due to unseen behavior, in particular for time, data, and resource constraints.
\par
Online process mining approaches can be used for PCM, to train and update prediction models based on evolving event streams, and to estimate the probability of a violation of a compliance constraint based on a set of possible violations.
\par
Compliance violation risk can be assessed by calculating the probabilities of satisfying/violating compliance constraints. These probabilities can be updated continuously to assess the risk of violations.
\par
PPM approaches train classifiers based on available data and use them to predict the next activity. These classifiers can be used to determine the underlying decision rule, enabling fine-grained root cause analysis.
\par
When considering compliance constraints that span across multiple processes and process instances, it is necessary to predict interactions between the affected process instances and their behavior, as well as the effects of the constraints on data and/or resources shared by processes/instances.
\par
Life cycle handling in PPM and PCM might increase prediction quality and applicability in real-world settings. For example, if an activity is suspended or aborted, a compliance violation might occur.
\par
Mitigation actions can be assessed based on compliance violation predictions combined with root cause analysis. These actions can be either countermeasures to avoid the compliance violation or countermeasures to compensate the failure.
\par
PCM requires an aggregated view on several perspectives, including the compliance constraints and the process respectively process instance perspective, together with continuous updates. Visualization approaches should convey information on root causes for compliance violations, the current prediction model in use, and mitigation actions together with their effects.
\par
The input data for PPM and PCM approaches are often small or big, and contain hidden/invisible parts due to confidentiality requirements of the partners. The collection, provision, and preparation of (real-world) data for different process scenarios containing multiple perspectives remains an ongoing community challenge.
\par
Including context data into PPM and PCM can significantly increase prediction capabilities and quality. One challenge is encoding context data, and updating prediction models at the presence of continuous context data is also a challenge.
\par
This survey follows the research method depicted in Fig. 1, and incorporates existing surveys as basis whenever possible. Despite this careful method design, new approaches on PPM are published constantly, and therefore, might not be covered within this paper yet.
\par
The main focus of this paper is on prediction tasks and compliance monitoring. Several concept drift detection approaches are discussed, as well as updating prediction models at the presence of concept drift.
\par
We used surveys to identify papers that address the investigated research directions, but we also conducted a full search without restricting the publication dates first and then compared the identified set of papers to existing surveys to limit the risk of missing out relevant prior work.
\par
This study provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of the Predictive Compliance Monitoring (PCM) problem.
\par
This paper presents an extensive compilation of literature on PCM and related fields. It concludes that no specific PCM approaches exist.
\par
The PCM problem must address the compliance monitoring functionalities as originally proposed by [64] in 2015, and must also address the predictability of the prediction results and input data requirements.

Existing approaches to predictive process monitoring are categorized and assessed along a wish list of PCM challenges. The assessment finds some capabilities to be supported, but no comprehensive solution for all PCM challenges.
\par
The open challenges for predictive process and compliance monitoring are identified, together with the PPM-PCM wish list. Based on the identified open challenges, research directions for predictive process and compliance monitoring are elaborated.},

  abstract = {Business  Process  Compliance  (BPC)  means  ensuring  that  business  processes  are  in  accordance  with  relevant  compliance  requirements.  Thus,  BPC  is  an  essential  part  of  both  business  process  management  (BPM)  and  compliance  management  (CM).  Digitization  has  also  been  referred  to  as  a  ``digital  revolution''  that  describes  a  technological  change  that  has  extended  to  many  organizational  areas  and  tasks,  including  compliance.  Current  efforts  to  digitize,  e.g.,  by  realizing  cyber-physical  systems,  rely  on  the  automation  and  interoperability  of  systems.  In  order  for  CM  not  to  hamper  these  efforts,  it  becomes  an  increasingly  relevant  issue  to  digitize  compliance  as  well. The managerial perspective of compliance comprises several phases, which together represent a CM life-cycle. Efforts to digitize compliance require bundling interoperable BPC technologies, methods, and tools supporting this life-cycle in a consolidated manner. Several approaches addressing the field of BPC have already been developed and explored. Based on a systematic literature review, we examined these approaches in terms of their suitability for supporting the CM life-cycle phases in support of the digitization of compliance. The results of our literature review show which CM life-cycle phases are supported by BPC approaches and which phases are the focus of research. Moreover, the results show that a purely sequential clustering, as specified in a CM life-cycle, is not always suitable for the bundling of BPC approaches in support of the digitization of compliance. Consequently, we propose a novel, task-oriented clustering of BPC approaches that is particularly oriented toward interoperability.},

However, there are criticisms that the regulation of occupational health and safety could be restricting the impulses of innovation and industrial development. This has led to proposals to repeal regulations to reduce the regulatory burden when possible. This work aims to delve into the difficulties that organisations encounter in their attempts to comply with occupational health and safety legislation and manage the process effectively. A systematic review was conducted of published studies that have analysed the relationship between occupational health and safety (OHS) management and compliance with legislation, regulations and rules. The search for relevant publications mainly used international bibliographic databases and scientific search engines. Quotes from other authors were also examined. This review provides knowledge on how compliance and noncompliance with legislation influences daily health and safety management in companies. The review highlights and discusses both successful regulatory strategies and the main difficulties, weaknesses, limitations and challenges companies face when adopting and complying with these regulations. This study concludes that management of legal compliance in companies, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises has become a complicated task. Management of occupational health and safety systems should not only be based on prescriptive principles and the detection of non-compliance, but also on proactive principles including an examination of how legal compliance affects daily performance.},

The European Commission (2005) states that legislation is an important part of the process to manage organisations and companies. It focuses on providing safe working conditions by applying the legislation.
\par
When accidents do take place, the investigation report should identify all cases of non-compliance detected during the investigation. The expert's testimony can be used in court, and the tractor effect is a powerful tool for improving processes and results in health and safety in companies.
\par
Regulations and their enforcement are crucial for economic development. Companies must participate in the regulatory process.
\par
In small and medium-sized enterprises, most problems with health and safety regulations exist. These companies employ around 75 million people and account for 82\% of all work-related injuries.
\par
This study looked at the relationship between occupational health and safety management and compliance with legislation, regulation and rules in small and medium-sized enterprises.
\par
A systematic review is a systematic process that identifies, selects and evaluates all the literature from a certain level of agreed quality that is relevant for a research question.
\par
The period being studied covers from 1987 to July 2018 and a bibliographic search was performed on four international bibliographic databases using 24 different combinations of keywords.
\par
After excluding repetitions, 197 results were obtained, of which 127 were articles, 45 were conference papers and 25 were books. After reading the entire text of these 55 results, 20 articles, 4 conference papers and 1 book were selected for further analysis.
\par
The publications that were eventually chosen were used to create the classification presented in Table 2.
\par
Despite the plentiful bibliographic references on developing models, theories and methods to manage health and safety, few studies discuss the impact of non-compliance with legislation in this matter. Hale and Swuste (1998) provided procedures to help companies meet the rules by creating a database with practical solutions for health and safety issues.
\par
Laurence (2005) concluded that the Australian mining industry should not continue to create more rules and regulations that aim to cover all aspects of mining, because such wide-ranging and detailed regulating standards and health and safety management plans do not "connect" with the miners.
\par
A study by Jacinto et al. (2011) and Morillas et al. (2013) analysed the adoption and implementation of the European Council Directive 89/391/CEE of 12 June (European Council, 1989) regarding the application of measures to promote improvements in workers' health and safety in the workplace.
\par
Gomes (2008) studied a large sample of fatal accidents and identified a series of blind spots where the legislation is either not clear or insufficient. This work revealed that the investigation process must include an analysis of the related "legal factors".
\par
Two publications were referenced as an application of legal non-compliance detection in occupational accident investigations. Both publications identified that a considerable percentage of the reports being analysed identified some legal violation committed in the event under investigation.
\par
The relationship between safety management and complying with standards is complicated, and it is possible that more attention is being given to compliance than to the safety practices themselves. This is because lagging indicators are used instead of leading indicators.
\par
In construction, leading indicators include detection of legal non-compliance in audits done by the companies, or violations of procedures or processes.
\par
Hale (2006) suggested that studies be performed on legislation regarding the use of sufficiently clear rules, and even self-regulation in the context of SMEs.
\par
Recent strategies and legislation on occupational health and safety are founded on knowledge acquired in large companies, whereas research in this area has been scarce in SMEs. It is necessary to develop a better understanding of how owners and managers of small and medium-sized enterprises define their company identity.
\par
In order to reduce the regulatory burden, self-regulation emerged as an important tool for implanting, managing or updating occupational health and safety management systems. However, not all companies were happy to have the "burden" of self-regulation imposed on them.
\par
The effect of standard-based self-regulation in companies in the field of legal compliance management poses several challenges for regulators and certifiers, including the need for effective auditing tools and the need to know what proportion of companies can be trusted.
\par
Accident causality models and organizations have evolved over time, with a move from the simple linear model to complex linear or epidemiological models. Resilience Engineering considers that accidents are a non-linear phenomenon that emerges from a complex system that leads to systemic models of accidents.
\par
Companies often move in the dilemma between operational requirements and legal compliance requirements, but resilience and legal compliance should not be incompatible. Resilience can support compliance by creating a "space of manoeuvre" based on the experience and adaptability of the workers.
\par
This bibliographic review discusses how compliance with legislation, regulations and standards influences health and safety management in companies.
\par
This study showed that regulatory compliance improves occupational health and safety, but that the limited resources of small and medium-sized enterprises can make compliance with regulations difficult. However, self-regulation can be a way to reduce regulatory obligations.
\par
Best practices for managing occupational health and safety systems in large companies and SMEs should include not only prescriptive principles but also proactive ones, and both public authorities and companies should promote the improvement of working conditions through the elaboration of standards and the development of actions that promote compliance.

  abstract = {Data privacy polices mandate requirements to protect the privacy of individuals, prevent fraud, and support audits. Organizations also implement their own internal data policies to minimize liabilities and protect user privacy. In practice, it is difficult (or impossible with most systems active today) to achieve the desired purpose of these policies due to technological limitations of storage systems. These limitations are ultimately caused by the lack of native database support for data privacy compliance. This paper surveys the principles of data compliance and analyzes the requirements imposed on organizations. We begin by defining data compliance terminology that must be shared between legal and technology domain experts; legislation and litigation examples provide real-world context and motivation for our analysis. Since the data life cycle model is universally accepted in data management, we next discuss how data compliance can be integrated into this model to fully support data management policies. Finally, we consider the open problems with current data storage systems and discuss the requirements for automated privacy regulation compliance.},
  note = {wordtune summary
\par
Data privacy policies mandate requirements to protect the privacy of individuals, prevent fraud, and support audits. However, current storage systems do not support data privacy compliance, so organizations must implement their own internal data policies to minimize liabilities and protect user privacy.
\par
Data management by an organization is bound by data governance policies that define how the data must be stored and used. Failure to comply with these policies could result in large fines.
\par
Data policies set forth by legislation have been in place for decades. New policies are continuously introduced, and organizations must follow additional internal or business contact policies.
\par
The data life cycle model is a structure for organizations to understand and manage their data assets. This model is used to guide a discussion on future research necessary to remedy the database software shortcomings and facilitate automated compliance management.
\par
Figure 1 illustrates the connections between data life cycle management phases. Some data may never go through each phase.
\par
This paper analyzes current domain challenges and background information on data privacy compliance, and discusses technological shortcomings that must be explored to automate policy compliance.
\par
Business records are defined as any document containing new data, and are kept by any business institution, professional, or government agency.
\par
Business records can be represented using different logical layouts, and the process of mapping business records to underlying data can vary depending on an organization and the data storage medium.
\par
A data policy is a formally established rule for organizations dictating how long data must be saved, when access requires consent, and when data must be purged. Policies can be based on time or external events, such as employee termination.
\par
Multiple policies can apply to the same business record, and data points belonging to different business records may be governed by different policies.
\par
Data curators must be able to query the policies and the status of all business records in storage, and check for conflicts or overlap between different policies.
\par
Current database management systems do not incorporate automated robust data policy features, which increases compliance and customer privacy.
\par
Retention defines the conditions when a business record must be preserved. Retention thresholds must be set for time or event, and some retention requirements must be archived before every update.
\par
The processing of business records must be verified according to the customer's consent. Not all processing requires consent; data necessary to complete the business transaction does not require explicit consent.
\par
Purging is the permanent destruction of data in a business record. A business record purge can be accomplished by destroying the device which stored the data, erasing the decryption key, or erasing all data from all storage.
\par
Some policies require organizations to purge business records after a certain amount of time, and there are also regulations that require organizations to purge records at customer request.
\par
Government regulations that impact data privacy are discussed. Private organizations may also set additional policies.
\par
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) expanded consumer power over personal data in the European Union and was put into effect on May 25, 2018.
\par
The "Right to be Forgotten" allows individuals to request that companies delete all of their personal data.
\par
When customers request their data to be deleted, organizations must check if they are legally permitted to do so, and must process requests within a month.
\par
TIM was fined AC27.8 million by the Italian data protection authority for violating GDPR by making unwanted promotional calls to customers without their consent.
\par
California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and the California Attorney General began enforcing it on January 1, 2020. Despite the fact that some privacy advocates believe the Act did not go far enough, the California Secretary of State summarizes the position of the advocates for Proposition 24.
\par
In 2003-2004, the case of Zubulake v. UBS Warburg led to additional electronic record keeping requirements in New York, where companies were put on notice that they had to preserve all pertinent electronic data if they reasonably anticipated they might be sued.
\par
The United States passed a law in 1996 that raised the minimum standards of privacy and medical data, empowering individuals to control their data. HIPAA requires that an individual's data be destroyed at the expiration of a contract.
\par
HIPAA requires healthcare recipients in the United States to be clearly informed of their privacy rights. There is no automatic process in deployed database systems to report all active retention policies.
\par
In most organizations, every transaction creates data that could be stored and processed. The first step of compliance is mapping the new data to policy requirements.
\par
Organizations may automatically label data generated from specific sources as "Internal Only" or "Highly Confidential", but these labels may not align with data policy requirements.
\par
After data is created, it is stored in a data storage management system. Relational databases are used for structured data, while NoSQL databases are used for less structured data.
\par
When using advanced databases, the mapping of business records to the stored data is much more complex. Amazon S3 facilitates compliance with data retention policies when using a file-level object life-cycle management.
\par
Data may be used for multiple purposes, including storing customer information, running statistical analysis to discover underlying trends, and documenting business transactions. Data consent support must be an inherent part of data privacy management.
\par
HIPAA requires medical data to be retained for at least 6 years, so organizations must maintain archived data after the data is no longer needed for their operation. Archived data does not require regular updates nor is expected to be actively used.
\par
Some organizations retain data for the life of the company, while other policies require that data be destroyed when no longer needed or subject to retention requirements. HIPAA Subpart D 164.504 requires that data be destroyed at the end of a contract.
\par
To comply with purging requirements, systems must implement functionality that allows organizations to define business records and policies, and implement secure deletion to render the required data permanently and irrecoverably destroyed.
\par
Manually achieving compliance with data policy requirements is an extremely difficult task. To facilitate comprehensive policy enforcement, automated data policy compliance tools are required, and legacy systems will continue to be a difficult challenge.
\par
DBAs work with domain experts and legal counsel to define business records and retention requirements based on policies. Automated systems then reference these definitions to enforce policy compliance.
\par
Retention compliance is achieved by automatically archiving business records before deleting or updating data. A database must automatically cross-reference defined policies and retention criterion to archive data when deletes or updates would violate retention requirements.
\par
Lawsuits may impose sudden and critical retention requirements on various business records. To avoid violating these requirements, retention must be considered at each phase of the data life cycle.
\par
Regulations such as GDPR require user consent for certain types of data processing. Organizations must implement automated filtering where business records require consent for an input purpose, and must apply consent policies during data usage depending on whether consent is required.
\par
Consent is defined differently by different governing bodies. Multiple independent solutions may be required to satisfy the different definitions.
\par
Purging requires that organizations destroy their data after some criteria has been met. If data is destroyed prematurely, this does not violate compliance.
\par
To achieve compliance with retention policies, data must be purged from all backups and active storage, and from forensic tools. Automated systems must delete all files and tuples in a database as necessary.
\par
Secure deletion is a method for completely purging data from a storage system, but it is only applicable for physically accessible databases. To fully purge data from all storage, it is necessary to remove the data from active storage as well as backups.
\par
This paper outlined the requirements and benefits of automated compliance, but also detailed the performance cost of additional retention protections. Future research will have to balance system performance with automated compliance.
\par
In this paper, we outlined the data life cycle model and how to incorporate privacy compliance into the process to increase user privacy protections.},

Existing frameworks for data governance offer general guidelines and models but do not provide methods for responding to the specific requirements of an organization. This paper proposes goal-oriented conceptual modeling as a systematic approach for data governance that enables an organization to focus on their data-related objectives for generating insights and managing challenges while protecting their data. This approach builds upon existing modeling languages to complement generic data governance frameworks and achieve two outcomes. First, it provides a coherent way of connecting the mechanisms of data governance to enterprise governance objectives and business goals. Second, it makes data governance more understandable and communicable by enabling the exploration of alternatives, assessment of consequences, and uncovering of undesirable side-effects. The effectiveness of the proposed goal modeling approach is illustrated with a fictitious case study example. \textcopyright{} 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

The Center for Feasibility of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Indonesia ensures the safety of personnel and materials when defense materials are used/operated.
\par
The Ministry of Defense's feasibility organization is responsible for ensuring the feasibility of defense materials, research and development materials, domestic and foreign procurement materials, production and/or maintenance facilities, construction/facilities/buildings/laboratories, and development of airworthiness personnel.
\par
The Indonesian Ministry of Defense conducts annual routine programs to develop airworthiness personnel as military airworthiness inspectors. These programs include activities related to the assessment of the eligibility status of a military commodity, production facility, maintenance facility, and other infrastructure.
\par
The military feasibility technical implementation team consists of personnel who have the required qualifications and are authorized to administer military fitness certification. They must also understand the regulations and requirements related to the military worthiness certification process.
\par
The researcher determined two independent variables that influenced the performance of the military feasibility organization, namely "Strategic Planning" and "Personnel Competence".
\par
This study will discuss the influence of strategic planning and personnel competence on organizational performance mediated by compliance management, with the goal of improving the performance of the Military Airworthiness Organization.
\par
The researcher analyzed the background and previous research results of the problem and concluded that strategic planning and personnel competence greatly affect the performance of the material feasibility organization.
\par
The strategic planning of an organization is strongly influenced by the dynamics of the development of the strategic environment. The strategic planning process involves analyzing the environment, defining goals, developing strategies, and implementing them in order to achieve a superior performance.
\par
According to McClelland in Shaheen (2018) and Spencer in Ismail 2019 , competence is the basic characteristics possessed by an individual that have a direct effect on, or can predict, excellent performance.

The Police Agency in Dubai needs to apply strategic planning and innovative practices to achieve the best overall organizational performance.
\par
Compliance management is the process of monitoring the organization's compliance with all rules and norms that have an impact on organizational performance. It includes preventive and corrective measures, support of the organization in legal action, and development of procedures that impact legal liability and the image of the organization.
\par
In this study, the development of hypotheses included: H1: Strategic Planning has a positive and significant impact on organizational performance; H2: Competence of personnel has a positive and significant impact on organizational performance.
\par
A cross-sectional study was conducted on the strategic planning and personnel competence of the military feasibility inspectors at the Indonesian Ministry of Defense, the Army Airworthiness Service, the Naval Airworthiness Service and the Air Force Airworthiness Service.
\par
In this study, Smart PLS software version 3.0 was used to analyze data. The validity and reliability test was performed using SPSS, and the structural model was used to test causality.
\par
The Smart PLS output has a t-statistics value of 1.96, which means the hypothesis is rejected.
\par
Testing the influence of the Strategic Planning variable on Organizational Performance obtained a regression coefficient value of 0.071, and testing the influence of the Personnel Competence variable on Organizational Performance obtained a regression coefficient value of 0.224.
\par
The regression coefficient value for the influence of Strategic Planning on Compliance management is 0.397, with a t-statistics value of 3.138. The value of t-statistics {$>$} 1.96 means that Strategic Planning has a positive and significant effect on Compliance management.
\par
Strategic Planning has a positive and significant effect on Organizational Performance through Compliance management. Personnel Competence has a positive and significant effect on Organizational Performance through Compliance management.
\par
This study shows that organizational performance can be improved by having a written plan, a procedure for detecting / anticipating errors on an ongoing basis, and taking into account factors outside the immediate environment of the organization.
\par
The findings of this study show that if personnel have the will to increase work motivation, are tenacious in completing work, are confident in their abilities, always try to understand problems, and have innovation in work, then organizational performance can be improved.
\par
The results of testing the third hypothesis show that Strategic Planning performed by the organization will affect Compliance management. This will affect all members of the organization to be more effective at work.
\par
The results of this study prove that personnel with a positive attitude towards work, emotional control, tenacity, confidence in their abilities, understanding of problems, mastery of work-related knowledge areas, and innovation in work will be more obedient.
\par
This study shows that compliance management has a positive impact on organizational performance, and if all members of the Indonesian Ministry of Defense feasibility center, the TNI-AD Airworthiness Service, the TNI-AL Airworthiness Service and the TNI-AU Airworthiness Service, comply with compliance management, organizational performance will automatically be achieved well.
\par
The results of this study show that compliance management mediates the effect of strategic planning on organizational performance, and that compliance management is significant for the achievement of organizational performance.
\par
The results show that compliance management mediates the effect of personnel competence on organizational performance, and that compliance management has a positive and significant influence on organizational performance.
\par
The results of the study prove that strategic planning and personnel competence have a positive but not significant effect on organizational performance. Personnel competency is needed to guarantee defense material safety requirements, and strategic planning is needed to implement compliance management.
\par
The higher the knowledge, attitudes and skills of the personnel in the material feasibility organization, the higher the compliance management will be. Compliance management has a positive and significant impact on organizational performance, and can improve the performance of the organization by ensuring the fulfillment of defense material safety.
\par
This research has several limitations, especially in terms of time. Besides, it only discusses two elements of strategic management, namely strategic planning and personnel competence, as independent variables on organizational performance.
\par
Based on the research findings, it can be concluded that strategic planning does not significantly affect organizational performance, that personnel competence positively and significantly affects organizational performance, that compliance management positively and significantly affects organizational performance, and that compliance management mediates the effect of strategic planning.
\par
To improve organizational performance, strategic planning, personnel competence and compliance management must be considered. Strategic planning should be based on the understanding that the ability to master the use of work-related facilities is a key competitive advantage.
\par
Compliance management improves organizational performance by ensuring that all levels comply with regulations.
\par
Future research should explore variables that can improve the performance of the feasibility organization, such as technology variables, value system, organization culture, social innovation process, strategic management information system, and organizational culture.

Through the GDPR, individuals are able to better control their personal data in the face of new technological developments. While the GDPR is highly advantageous to individuals, complying with it poses major challenges for organizations that control or process personal data. Since no automated solution with broad industrial applicability currently exists for GDPR compliance checking, organizations have no choice but to perform costly manual audits to ensure compliance. In this paper, we share our experience building a UML representation of the GDPR as a first step towards the development of future automated methods for assessing compliance with the GDPR. Given that a concrete implementation of the GDPR is affected by the national laws of the EU member states, GDPR's expanding body of case law and other contextual information, we propose a two-tiered representation of the GDPR: a generic tier and a specialized tier. The generic tier captures the concepts and principles of the GDPR that apply to all contexts, whereas the specialized tier describes a specific tailoring of the generic tier to a given context, including the contextual variations that may impact the interpretation and application of the GDPR. We further present the challenges we faced in our modeling endeavor, the lessons we learned from it, and future directions for research.},

\par
Regulatory compliance is a well-studied area, but empirical evidence on challenges faced by industrial practitioners is still lacking. In this paper, we report on an industrial case study at Ericsson AB.
\par
Modern software development is driven by requirements from various stakeholders, including business stakeholders and community stakeholders. Compliance requirements are typically expressed in general terms, omitting implementation-specific details, and may be interpreted differently by affected parties, resulting in rework, delays, financial and legal repercussions.
\par
This study explores how compliance requirements are handled at Ericsson AB. It focuses on understanding challenges and potential improvements in interpreting organization-wide compliance requirements.
\par
This paper presents background in regulatory compliance concepts and terms, and outlines the research questions, methods, and findings.
\par
Regulatory compliance addresses goals and mitigates risks by ensuring adherence to regulations like standards, laws, guidelines, or specifications.
\par
Compliance modeling tasks involve extracting text from regulations, formalizing that text, checking that the formalized representation of regulations captures correctly compliance requirements, and analyzing the state of compliance of an organization, process, or product.
\par
We analyzed available secondary studies on the topic of regulatory compliance and extracted 22 primary studies related to checking and analysis of regulatory and legal compliance requirements from them. The studies cover classical regulated domains such as finance, medical, law, public administration, automotive, and avionics.
\par
In the 22 papers, 50\% discuss software development and its artifacts. The most common challenges explicitly mentioned are complexity and ambiguity of regulations by nature, documentation and modeling of the relevant regulatory constraints and their derivations, establishing and keeping traceability of artifacts, and change management and evolution.
\par
A synthesis of this body of work shows that regulatory compliance is a well studied area, but there is still a gap of knowledge about the challenges faced by industrial practitioners.
\par
We conducted an exploratory case study to understand the current processes and challenges associated with checking and analysis of compliance requirements.
\par
Ericsson AB, a large multinational company, has over 100 products and must comply with generic requirements. The central unit proposes and maintains design rules and guidelines for supporting the development teams.
\par
System management and product management perform an initial analysis to identify impacted sub-systems. The development unit of each impacted sub-system is responsible for ensuring compliance with the selected compliance requirements.
\par
The company's compliance process is used to verify whether sub-systems are compliant with the compliance requirements.
\par
To maximize the validity of our results, we conducted two open-ended group discussions and a workshop with multiple researchers and practitioners to understand the current state-of-the-practice on the verification of the compliance requirements. During the workshop, we collected data using an instrument and conducted two semi-structured interviews with the information owner and test manager of the units responsible for writing and verifying the compliance requirements. We analyzed the data using coding and assigned interpretive codes to the challenges.
\par
We designed a workshop instrument to collect data about different compliance activities involving multiple units. The instrument asks participants to describe one compliance work-related activity in which they are involved, the challenges they face, the inputs and outputs they depend on, and the categories of compliance requirements that are more challenging to handle.
\par
The study participants identified several challenges related to the compliance requirements, and also suggested several improvements to the compliance work. These improvements are grouped into three categories: requirements specification related challenges, process related challenges and resource related challenges.
\par
In this category, we included challenges related to the way the compliance requirements are specified. These challenges include the challenge of interpreting the compliance requirements in the context of their product, and the challenge of performing the trade-offanalysis.
\par
The participants highlighted the need to improve the alignment between different compliance activities and the coordination between different roles and units involved in the compliance process. They also suggested to introduce better requirements management tools to effectively manage and communicate the compliance requirements.
\par
In this category, we included challenges related to the resources (people, tools) required for handling the compliance requirements. The participants highlighted the lack of available resources and time, as well as the lack of awareness of the developers about the compliance requirements and design rules.
\par
While research on supporting modelling, checking, analysing and enacting compliance tasks is abound, studies that investigate compliance challenges in practice are rare. Most studies base their findings on educated opinion or experience.
\par
Common challenges to compliance management include the lack of connecting compliance to business objectives, the lack of communicating a common understanding of compliance continuously to employees, inconsistencies in applying regulations, and the lack of tool support for compliance management and monitoring.
\par
Both Boella et al. and Ghanavati etal. report on the difficulty of interpreting regulations, and Nekvi and Madhavji found that there are several challenges in identifying and accessing relevant set of regulatory documents.
\par
Looking at the studies that investigate regulatory requirements, we observe that most rely on experience and educated opinion reports. Hence, we conclude that there exists a core of common challenges to regulatory requirements.
\par
We used a workshop instrument to connect different compliance activities and identify the state of compliance practice through which the compliance requirements are analyzed, implemented, and verified. The instrument helped us structure the discussion session around the main themes involving compliance activities and their purpose, challenges, and inputs and outputs.
\par
Our choice of industry partner emerged from the pre-existing relationship with them. We were able to draw from the insights and experiences of a broad range of stakeholders.
\par
Subjectivity plays a vital role in qualitative studies, but can be mitigated by a trustful long-enduring relationship with the partner, by re-evaluating the results along the final presentation, and by re-evaluating the coding.
\par
We investigated the state of practice in regulatory compliance in Ericsson with an industrial case study. We developed a workshop instrument to identify both gaps and challenges within the regulatory compliance process.},

To establish and ensure regulatory compliance, constraints need to be extracted from the documents and integrated into process models capturing existing operational practices.

Additionally, new regulations must be integrated and checked against existing process models. To address these challenges, we provide an approach that uses natural language processing to automatically support compliance assessment between regulatory documents and process model repositories. The outcome is a pairwise matching between parts of a regulatory document and process models from a repository. This matching can be used to either determine the coverage of regulations by a process model or to guide compliance assessment by ranking models based on their fitness and cost.

To ensure compliance with regulatory documents, constraints must be extracted from the documents and integrated into process models capturing existing operational practices. To support compliance assessment, a natural language processing approach is used to automatically match regulatory documents and process models.
\par
Several approaches for checking regulatory compliance based on process models exist, but they all abstract from the regulatory documents themselves and assume the existence of a set of extracted compliance constraints. This work aims to fill this gap by directly assessing compliance between process models and regulatory documents during design time.
\par
In order to assess compliance with regulatory documents, we match paragraphs with process models using a fitness score and a cost score. The fitness score determines the likelihood that a paragraph pertains to a particular process model, whereas the cost score quantifies the amount of detected process compliance violations.
\par
The remainder of the paper describes a compliance assessment approach and presents two real-world case studies.
\par
This section presents an exemplary scenario for assessing the compliance between regulatory documents and business process models. The scenario involves extracting the compliance rules from a regulatory document and determining whether the rules are properly implemented by the business process model.
\par
To perform step (1), a method needs to be able to differentiate between sentences describing actual constraints and those providing additional clarification or context. Step (2) requires an approach to deal with the flexible nature of natural language.
\par
We use a process model repository M and a set of paragraphs P stemming from a regulatory document P to detect compliance issues. We use the fitness and cost scores to detect three violation types: an activity is not incorporated in the model, activities are performed in the wrong order, and resources are not assigned.
\par
Process models can be created using a variety of modeling languages.
\par
A flow relation is a set of gateways, a connected graph, a function maps gateways to types, and a partial function maps tasks to resources.
\par
Our approach parses all process models in a repository and finds ones that match the provided definition. This prevents the detection of compliance violations involving resources.
\par
Our approach extracts from a regulatory document a set of activities that must be performed, a strict order relation between the activities, and a partial function determining which resources must execute which activities.
\par
To extract obligatory activities from a paragraph, we first distinguish between sentences that describe actual process constraints and sentences that provide contextual information. We then extract individual activities from the sentences in P {${'}$}.
\par
We extract order restrictions from natural language text by identifying signal words and using these to identify specific order restrictions.
\par
To identify resources RP associated with obligatory activities, we employ NLP techniques such as dependency parsing and POS tagging. The corresponding element in RP would be given as terminal must, execute, received, command.
\par
The compliance assessment between a process model repository and a regulatory document is based on the computation of fitness and cost scores.
\par
We use semantic similarity measures to identify correspondences between obligatory activities in a paragraph and its most similar process model element in a process model. We filter out unimplemented activities and define fitness as the average similarity values obtainable for the obligatory activities in OP that are greater than .
\par
The overall cost score is computed by summing the scores of the three types of violations, where wo,wso,wr are weights that allow users to alter the relative importance of the violation types.
\par
Missed Obligatory Activities (V1) are quantified by the minimal similarity value required for an obligatory activity o to be recognized as implemented in a model through task (or event) t.
\par
To recognize strict order violations, we compare the strict order relation SP extracted from a paragraph P to the flow relation FM of the model, and assess the enforcement of such a constraint in the model by comparing the model to the paragraph.
\par
If the regulatory document specifies that an activity must be performed by a specific resource, but a different resource executes the corresponding process model task, a resource responsibility violation occurs.
\par
The compliance assessment of a paragraph-model pair can be done via the computed fitness and cost scores. The lower the costs, the better the compliance of a model to a paragraph.
\par
In a second application scenario, a recommender system is used to display a top-k list of paragraph-model correspondences. The top-k pairs are then ranked based on their cost score.
\par
A prototype was implemented in Python3 to assess compliance with regulatory documents. It uses the spaCy library for NLP tasks.
\par
We conducted experiments on Austrian's energy providers and GDPR implementation using an Intel Core i5-7200U @2.50 GHz processor (4 cores) and 8 GB RAM. The experiments took at most 16 min.
\par
The mean value of the AP value is computed for all 12 models in M. This value represents how good the fitness score performs.
\par
We use two configurations to extract obligatory activities in this use case: one that filters sentences and one that transforms clauses from all sentences into obligatory activities.
\par
The OP configuration achieves the best result for a fitness score of 0.8.5. However, the OP{${'}$} configuration achieves a better result for a fitness score of 0.6.
\par
We take seven process models for implementing the GDPR as input. We also consider GDPR Articles 5 to 50.
\par
We used a model for a data breach to identify relevant articles, and found that Article 40 contains one constraint.
\par
We tested several values for and found that the ideal value is at 0.4 for this model-paragraph matching. For a cost score of 1.0, Article 33's ranking is shifted down by one position while Article 34's ranking remains the same.
\par
The evaluation demonstrated that the higher the threshold, the lower the MAP, but that too many smaller similarities can also lower the MAP. When a model-paragraph alignment is not available, the fitness score can be used to select the parameter.
\par
If resources have different names in the model and paragraph, semantic similarity might fail to identify them as similar, and resource cost could increase tremendously.
\par
Various approaches provide semi-automatic support for business process compliance checking. Our work aims at detecting compliance issues during design time.
\par
Process constraints can be extracted from natural language text using approaches that compare textual process descriptions to process models, but these approaches assume that a textual process description relates to exactly one process model.
\par
This work enables the automatic assessment of compliance between process models and regulatory documents. The approach highlights potential violations and helps companies cope with frequent changes of regulations and of process models through automated support.},

\par
Compliance regulation is a model of government regulation based on compliance management system. It combines external supervision with enterprise self-discipline to promote enterprise self-discipline and good faith management.
\par
The relationship between government and market in regulation is an important subject in front of government regulators. Compliance regulation is a model of government regulation based on compliance management, which emphasizes beforehand guidance and make control of events, the government grasps the regulatory initiative.
\par
Enterprises can establish, develop, implement, evaluate, maintain, and improve an effective and responsive compliance management system within their organizations by implementing three key elements.
\par
The first step in building a compliance management system is to identify, analyze and evaluate compliance risks. This is done by relating the organization's compliance obligations to its activities, products, services and relevant aspects of its operations.
\par
Risk evaluation determines the need for controls based on the level of compliance risk the organization can accept.
\par
A risk-based approach to compliance management requires periodic assessments of compliance risks and changes to the structure, strategy or external environment of the organization. Noncompliances should be addressed immediately.
\par
Enterprises should plan actions to address compliance risks and evaluate the effectiveness of these actions. They should also establish compliance management system objectives at relevant functions and levels.
\par
Enterprises should define the objectives of the processes needed to solve compliance risks, establish criteria for the processes, implement control of the processes in accordance with the criteria, and keep documented information.
\par
Controls should be put in place to manage compliance obligations and risk, and achieve desired behaviour. These controls should be designed with sufficient rigour to facilitate achieving compliance obligations, and should be maintained, periodically evaluated and tested to ensure their continuing effectiveness.
\par
The public thinks cadres stand aside, government nonfeasance, and the people's livelihood problem is nobody's business, but in fact, government regulation involves wide range contents, heavy tasks, and big pressure.
\par
Double random one open method is an important measure of in-and-out supervision. To prevent problems happening from the root, we should strengthen the guidance and the controlling of matters in advance.
\par
Grass-roots government departments are faced with conflicting laws and regulations, and the process of administrative punishment is inconsistent with these laws and regulations.
\par
The administrative law enforcement department needs to be strengthened to deal with the source cases of complaints, appeals, reports, assigned by superior authorities and patrol inspection found. The rapid development of new social media marketing has brought new problems for regulatory enforcement.
\par
The United States legal system takes effective compliance management of enterprises as the influence factors of liability judgment and discretion of punishment, and encourages enterprises to build internal compliance management system to reduce illegal crime.
\par
Britain and France introduced the concept of compliance management into regulation in 2010 and 2016, respectively, based on organizational responsibility principle, and if the enterprise did not take the initiative to establish the compliance management system, substantial fines could be imposed.
\par
Compliance management, as the influence factors of liability judgement and discretion of punishment, is widely used to prevent, detect and punish incompliance of enterprises. It can reduce the stress of external supervision and burden and effectively prevent and stop the enterprise internal incompliance behavior.
\par
Enterprises should establish effective compliance management system to prevent government regulatory investigation, reduce penalties and make illegal plot "downgrade" inevitable. The government should make clear if enterprises have established effective compliance management system and compliance management system is effective.
\par
Government should build a compliance management information system for market supervision, and guide enterprises to build an effective compliance management system.
\par
The Changsheng biological vaccine event was exposed by staff in real-name, and ZTE Corporation was investigated and cruelly punished. Many incompliance cases happen, but the outsider of ordinary people and regulators always is kept in the dark.
\par
Compliance culture should be rooted in everyone's heart, and promoted through various forms of propaganda. Such people will create compliance in enterprises, and create a fair and orderly market competition environment.
\par
Enterprises are willing to conduct compliance management if regulatory agency recognized their compliance efforts and exempted them from punishment when non-compliance incidents happened. If the law enforcement idea is transformed from fire fighting mode to the whole process regulation, enterprise compliance management will be destroyed.
\par
This research was financially supported by several projects, including the Dean fund project of China National Institute of Standardization.},

  abstract = {Information security in an organization largely depends on employee compliance with information security policy (ISP). Previous studies have mainly explored the effects of command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches on employee ISP compliance. However, how social influence at both individual and organizational levels impacts the effectiveness of these two approaches has not been adequately explored. This study proposes a social contingency model in which a rules-oriented ethical climate (employee perception of a rules-adherence environment) at the organizational level and susceptibility to interpersonal influence (employees observing common practices via peer interactions) at the individual level interact with both command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches to affect ISP compliance. Using employee survey data, we found that these two social influence factors weaken the effects of both command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches on ISP compliance. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.},
  note = {wordtune summary
\par
This study proposes a social contingency model to explain how social influence at both individual and organizational levels affects employee compliance with information security policy.
\par
Organizations adopt and enforce information security policies to prevent noncompliance and thereby reduce information security incidents. In addition to sanctions and monitoring, self-imposed sanctions, personal norms, personal ethics, moral beliefs, moral commitment, shame and neutralization techniques, and self-regulatory approaches have been studied to predict ISP compliance.
\par
The basic premise of the literature cited above is that employee ISP compliance is instrumentally and/or normatively motivated. The instrumental view argues that employees are rational self-interested actors and that organizations actively enforce rules to increase compliance.
\par
Tyler and Blader (2005) showed that both instrumental and normative motivations work together in shaping compliance with organizational policies. However, the effects of command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches on ISP compliance are mixed, and boundary conditions reflect contextual and dispositional factors.
\par
We contest the assertation that social influence sets up boundaries for the effect of command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches on employee ISP compliance. We suggest that the work environment and the employee's propensity to seek and observe others' compliance behaviours serve as critical boundary conditions.
\par
This study proposes a social contingency model to explain how command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches affect employee ISP compliance. Social influence may lead employees to reconsider earlier perceptions of the likelihood of detection and the severity of sanctions.
\par
Social influence in a company may be manifested at both individual and organizational levels, and may be influenced by organizational culture and norms. Susceptibility to interpersonal influence may modify the effects of command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches on ISP compliance.
\par
This study aims to investigate the role of social influence on the effectiveness of command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches to ISP compliance. It provides useful insights to managers about the effectiveness of an organizational climate or designing an office layout to enhance ISP compliance.
\par
The command-and-control approach consists of extrinsic enforcement of the rules through incentives and sanctions as well as implementation of detection mechanisms to ensure discovery of wrongdoing. The command-and-control approach has traditionally served as the primary strategy for investigating employee rule-following in the context of ISP compliance.
\par
Some studies have suggested that moderating variables may explain the mixed results in the effectiveness of deterrence in reducing employee ISP violation intention, but in a consolidation effort, it was found that none of the moderating variables significantly moderated the relationship.
\par
The self-regulatory approach treats intrinsic desires as primary drivers of behaviour, with value congruence and legitimacy being the two main elements of the self-regulatory approach.
\par
Previous literature has investigated the effect of other intrinsic mechanisms such as personal norms, moral beliefs, moral commitments, and shame on employee ISP compliance. The self-regulatory approach is broader and more inclusive and focuses on the role of self-imposed punishments and rewards in driving employee compliance.
\par
Although most studies have shown that intrinsic motives affect ISP compliance, some studies have reported contradictory results. For example, Son (2011) showed that the effects of self-regulatory approach and moral commitment on ISP compliance are significant.
\par
Although no research has examined the effect of contextual and dispositional factors on ISP compliance behavior, previous studies have found that denial of (personal)responsibility and ascription of personal responsibility moderate the effect of intrinsic motives on ISP compliance behavior.
\par
Researchers have examined the effectiveness of command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches rooted in instrumental and normative perspectives in promoting ISP compliance.
\par
Rule compliance can be considered to be a social phenomenon. Individual behaviours are driven by continuous interactions among cognitive, behavioural, and environmental determinants.
\par
To prove that behavior is determined by cognitions alone, one would have to find a control group without cognitions.
\par
The command-and-control approach can influence an employee's rule compliance behaviour, but only if the organization communicates the consequences of ISP violations clearly. When an organization lacks commonly-accepted norms for rules and procedures, employees are more likely to take sanctions and detections mechanisms more seriously.
\par
The success of self-regulatory approach is rooted in an employee's intrinsic desire to comply with the ISP and a positive perception of value congruence and legitimacy of the rules. Social influence may alter the effectiveness of self-regulatory approach by signaling acceptability of the rules.
\par
Social influence in an organization can be narrowed down to individual and organizational level. A rules-oriented ethical climate can moderate the effects of command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches on ISP compliance.
\par
Social influence manifests itself through peer interactions, and can cause a behaviour to become more pronounced. It also manifests itself through a tendency to look to peers for identification of appropriate behaviours.
\par
An ethical climate refers to the shared perception of what is ethically appropriate and how ethical issues should be handled. In a high level ethical climate, employees make clear ethical judgments, while in a low level ethical climate, employees may have uncertain ethical judgments.
\par
A multi-dimensional ethical climate is comprised of two dimensions, namely ethical approach and ethical referent. The ethical approach has five subcategories: rules (company policies and procedures adherence), law and code (violation of laws), caring (welfare of others), instrumental (self-interest) and independence (personal beliefs adherence).
\par
A rules-oriented ethical climate focuses on a company's policy and procedure adherence and can be used as a psychological tool for organizational-level social influence. It differs from a self-regulatory ethical climate in that it captures employee perception of accepted behaviours regarding organizational rules.
\par
An ethical climate that values rules may lead to employees judging rule compliance as more of an ethics issue, and thus reducing the impact of command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches.
\par
Interpersonal sources of influence refer to non-organizational personal contacts that employees may consider obtaining information related to an issue at hand. This study shows that susceptibility to interpersonal influence diminishes the effects of command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches on ISP compliance.
\par
Susceptibility to interpersonal influence involves two dimensions, susceptibility to informational influence and susceptibility to normative influence. Informational influence involves seeking information from others and normative influence involves conforming to others' expectations.
\par
Susceptibility to interpersonal influence is measured by how often an employee actively observes others' behaviour or seeks information from others. This factor influences attitudes, norms, values, and aspirations in the context of smoking, drinking, music piracy, and other fields.
\par
Previous research posited that employees are rational self-interested actors that engage in either ISP compliance or noncompliance to maximize benefits to themselves. We hypothesize that the command-and-control approach will positively affect ISP compliance.
\par
We expect the self-regulatory approach to be positively related to ISP compliance because it activates feelings of personal responsibility to align employees' behaviour with organizational rules. Moreover, we expect the self-regulatory approach to be more effective than the command-and-control approach in promoting ISP compliance.
\par
A rules-oriented ethical climate encourages employees to adhere to organizational policies, whereas a weak rules-oriented ethical climate encourages employees to rely on command-and-control and/or self-regulatory approaches as alternatives to ethical climate in their ISP decision-making.
\par
We argue that a rules-oriented ethical climate can influence employee ISP decisions, and that a strong rules-oriented ethical climate could weaken other drivers affecting employee choices.
\par
Employees with discernible levels of susceptibility to interpersonal influence may display different levels of responsiveness to the command-and-control approach. They may make decisions based on the information collected from others, and may mimic the behaviours of important others to project a positive self-image.
\par
Susceptibility to interpersonal influence can undermine the impact of self-regulatory approach on ISP compliance. Employees with a low level of susceptibility to interpersonal influence are expected to follow their own internal repertoire of values and assumptions regarding ISP compliance.
\par
We collected data from employees recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (or MTurk). MTurk is an online crowdsourcing labour market that provides a platform through which one can assign workers to do diverse tasks in exchange for payment adjusted to the quality of the finished task.
\par
We used instruments from prior studies to measure the key constructs in our model, which were taken conceptually as second-order formative constructs. The items were adapted from Tyler and Blader (2005), Bearden et al. (1989) and Victor et al. (1988).
\par
The measurement items were examined by IS faculty members and PhD students, and 100 MBA students carried out a pilot study.
\par
We used structural equation modelling to test our model. A component-based partial least squares approach was used to validate measurement scales.
\par
The Smart-PLS software package was used for analysis, and a bootstrapping procedure was used to estimate the path coefficient weights and their significance.
\par
We calculated factor and cross-loadings, average variance extracted (AVE) values, composite reliability, and Cronbach 's alpha values for each construct. The items satisfied convergent validity and discriminant validity.
\par
Composite reliability and Cronbach {$<$}unk{$>$} scores of all constructs were greater than .70, suggesting that they all achieved acceptable reliability scores.
\par
We estimated the second-order formative variables of the command-and-control, the self-regulatory approach, and susceptibility to interpersonal influence using repeated indicators method.
\par
Multicollinearity is a problem for measures of formative constructs, but in this study, all VIFs were lower than 3.3, so no construct suffered from multicollinearity.
\par
To remedy and control for presence of common method bias, several procedural and statistical approaches were implemented, including Harman's single-factor test, partial correlation procedures, and full collinearity assessment approach.
\par
The PLS estimation showed that employees with lower education were more likely to comply with the organizational ISP.
\par
H1 specifies that the command-and-control approach is positively associated with employee ISP compliance. H2 specifies that the self-regulatory approach is positively associated with employee ISP compliance.
\par
We created multiplicative terms by cross-multiplying items of relevant constructs and calculated coefficients using the bootstrapping technique. The results showed that ethical climate negatively moderated the effect of command-and-control approach and self-regulatory approach on ISP compliance.
\par
To test the importance of a rules-oriented ethical climate and susceptibility to interpersonal influence, we used F-statistics.
\par
The moderating effect of a rules-oriented ethical climate, susceptibility to interpersonal influence, and a self-regulatory approach on ISP compliance was significant.
\par
We further validated the moderating effect of H3 using Cohen's f2, and found that H3, H4, H5, and H6 had small to medium effects on the main effect.
\par
The effects of command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches on ISP compliance are weaker when a rules-oriented ethical climate and susceptibility to interpersonal influence are high.
\par
This study shows that both the command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches predict employee ISP compliance, but the effect of the self-regulatory approach is more important than the effect of the command-and-control approach.
\par
The results support our argument that ISP compliance could be a social phenomenon. The command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches are more effective when a rules-oriented ethical climate is perceived to be low, and the effect of the command-and-control approach is weaker for employees highly susceptible to interpersonal influence.
\par
This research contributes to the information security literature by examining the effects of social influence and rules-oriented ethical climate on ISP compliance.
\par
Although some studies found that deterrence effectively promotes ISP compliance, others reported that deterrence has no such effect. Our study sheds light on contingency factors that may affect the efficacy of deterrence and helps reconcile some of the mixed findings found in the literature.
\par
In information security literature, most studies conceptualize social influence as subjective norms or normative beliefs and/or descriptive norms. Our study adds a new perspective by investigating social influence at both the organizational (via rules-oriented ethical climate) and individual (via susceptibility to interpersonal influence) level.
\par
Our findings align with previous studies that show social influence plays an important role in employee compliance behaviour, but our study brings the contingency effects of social influence into focus.
\par
This research has several implications for information security practices in organizations. It shows that employee compliance stems from the perception that ISP violations are likely to be detected and punished, and from the degree to which they believe the rules to be legitimate.
\par
This study revealed that social influence plays an important role in the effects of command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches on ISP compliance. Managers should consider leveraging key factors, namely a rules-oriented ethical climate and susceptibility to interpersonal influence, when implementing either approach.
\par
Susceptibility to interpersonal influence can significantly impact the effectiveness of command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches, so managers should communicate that other employees comply with the ISP.
\par
Our study has limitations, but it provides some support for the causal direction proposed in our model. Future research could examine employee interactions with supervisors and teammates.
\par
Although we tried to mitigate the effect of social desirability on our study, we believe that the nature of our study skewed the responses towards ISP compliance.
\par
Although our sample size was sufficient to test our theoretical framework, a larger sample size could provide more statistical power and performance. Also, because our participants were drawn from employees residing in the United States, future studies should focus on particular industries.
\par
This study overlooks the role that group-level factors may play in ISP compliance. Future research may consider incorporating groups into their design to examine how group-level factors interact with individual-level variables to affect ISP compliance.
\par
Other ethical climates (caring, law and code, instrumental, and independence) could be relevant within the context of this study, but they are beyond the scope of this study.
\par
This study investigated the effect of social influence on ISP compliance by testing the effectiveness of command-and-control and self-regulatory approaches. It found that the effectiveness was diminished when social influence was higher.
\par
We acknowledge that past studies have investigated motivational factors associated with ISP compliance, noncompliance, violation, abuse, shadow, and misuse, and that the effect of moral disengagement is contingent on the contextual and dispositional factors. We also modeled the second-order constructs as reflective measurements.
\par
Sage has published several articles on social learning and deviant behavior, and on the theory of moral disengagement.

In 1999, Bandura reported that moral disengagement is the perpetration of inhumanities. In 1998, Banerjee, Cronan, T. P., Jones, T. W., and Marshall, K. studied situational ethics to model IT ethics.

ISP compliance behaviour consists of following your organization's ISP, using your organization's ISP to guide you how to access to and use information assets, following the requirement of your organization's ISP, and doing as your organization's ISP request. To make sure that I correctly follow the organization's Information Security Policy, I often observe what others do, consult with other people, and ask my coworkers about it. I also comply with the organization's Information Security Policy when I think others will approve of it.
\par
I feel that complying with a particular ISP policy will enhance my image.

The average variance extracted (AVE) values represent the square root of (AVE) values.

Previous studies have suggested several methods to control for common method biases. Schwarz et al. (2017) used the unmeasured latent method factor technique.
\par
Harman's single factor test showed that eleven factors explained 71.51\% of the data variance.
\par
We assessed social desirability bias using the Marlowe-Crowne social desirability scale, and found that CMB was not a major concern.
\par
To identify a potential marker variable, we identified three theoretically unrelated items, and used interpersonal conflict as a correlational marker.
\par
All significant correlations stayed significant after incorporating the marker variable into the partial correlation analysis. The differences between the two comparative models were minor, indicating that confounding by background variables was not a major issue.
\par
We followed several procedural remedies to reduce the effect of common method bias, including using established prevalidated reliable items, ensuring the anonymity of participants, randomized the order of items, and not providing any explanation, definitions, or examples for the constructs used in our survey. Schwarz et al. (2017) investigated the effectiveness of popular techniques in detecting CMB. They found that the exploratory factor analysis of all the measurement items yielded 11 factors, which explained 71.51\% of the data variance. The CFA marker approach is part of partial correlation procedures designed to control for common method biases. It involves partialling out the effect of social desirability, partialling out a "marker" variable, and partialling out a general factor score.
\par
We used three marker variables in our model to examine the relationship between ISP compliance behaviour, detection of behaviour, knowledge of ISPs, legitimacy, rules-oriented ethical climate, reaction to behaviour, susceptibility to informational influence, susceptibility to normative influence, and value congruence.
\par
Method is helpful in identifying the specific factor responsible for method effects, however it is not directly applicable to PLS. A full collinearity assessment was performed instead, and the results suggest that CMB is not a concern in our data.
\par
We conducted a literature review to identify studies that dealt with extrinsic and/or intrinsic motivations and employee security behaviour. We also included conferences and low-tier journals in our review to offer a balanced understanding of the phenomenon.
\par
We used several article repositories to find relevant studies on deterrence. We excluded conceptual pieces and only included empirical studies and excluded studies that incorporated exact or conceptually similar elements of the command-and-control or the self-regulatory approach in their model.
\par
They investigated and compared 11 theories and proposed a unified model of information security policy compliance, which combines moral considerations and social norms into a construct called role values.
\par
Perceived certainty and severity of sanctions and perceived benefits predict IUP compliance intention, but procedural justice and self-control do not.
\par
Researchers found that perceived self-efficacy, descriptive norms, and response cost mediate the relationship between perceived severity of sanctions and employee ISP compliance intention.
\par
The authors analyzed data from 500 fortune companies in the Middle East and found that value congruence negatively impacted ISP compliance intentions.
\par
The authors found that employee positions (lower vs. higher levels) influence ISP compliance if tailoredstrategies (participating in the ISP decision-making process vs. enhancing the meaningfulness of policy compliance) are used.
\par
Researchers found that sanctions did not deter shadow IT intentions, but that neutralization reduced shame towards violating shadow IT policies, making sanctions less significant.
\par
Justice, the belief that the organization is fair in rules creation and implementation, contributes to compliance intention with non-work-related computing rules.
\par
The authors found that threat vulnerability, sanction severity, and sanction certainty are significant predictors of ISP violation intentions, and that the stability meta-trait moderates the effect of threat, self-efficacy, and sanction severity.
\par
Adding the gender variable to the model, he found that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control predict compliance intentions.
\par
The researchers found that understandability of ISP significantly lowers employee ISP violation intentions, and that gender moderates the relationship between understandability of ISP and employee ISP violation intentions.
\par
Chen et al. (2012) found that the severity and certainty of sanctions are significant in both directly and indirectly deterring technology misuse intention.
\par
Top management participation in information security initiatives impacts organizational culture, which influences employee attitudes towards compliance with ISP.
\par
Researchers found that culture played a significant role in reducing IS misuse intention in the US.
\par
Employee ISP violation intentions are predicted by moral beliefs, not by penalties or lack of respect.
\par
Researchers studied the effect of perceived certainty, severity, and celerity of sanctions on employee intention to commit computer misconduct, and found that moral beliefs were the strongest deterrent.
\par
Siponen et al. (2010) found that personal norms significantly predict IUP intention and that sanction severity predicts IUP intention for those with low personal norms.
\par
The researchers compared the effect of sanctions with the context of their scenarios (eg, password sharing) and hinted that moral commitment may influence the effect of sanctions.
\par
The severity of sanctions has a negative impact on ISP compliance intention, and may be due to the fact that employees do not take penalties seriously.
\par
A model was developed to examine the influence of moral reasoning and values on compliance with ISP. It was found that moral reasoning (Preconventional) and moral values (Openness to change) significantly predicted both hypothetical and actual ISP compliance.
\par
It has been suggested that studies using general deterrence theory (GDT) (or its elements) enjoy quite mixed results. This is most likely due to the lack of investigating dispositional and contextual moderating variables, such as self-efficacy, descriptive norms, and response cost.
\par
Intrinsic motivations are based on how a task provides feeling of contentment, whereas the punishment is self-imposed, and can include moral beliefs, moral commitments, and/or shame. Many studies have reported intrinsic motivations significantly predict employee compliance behaviour, however, there are studies that reported mixed results.
\par
The effect of shame on employee ISP violations has been shown to be inconclusive. However, the effect of moral commitment, measured using the scale adopted form D'Arcy et al. 2009, was shown to be insignificant in predicting employee ISP compliance.
\par
There are few studies that investigated and confirmed the contributing role of moral disengagement mechanisms on employee ISP violation intentions. Contextual and dispositional factors may be important enablers or disablers of intrinsic motives on employee ISP compliance.
\par
Sample size influences statistical significance of hypotheses. A sample size of 246 cases is adequate to detect the significance of all hypotheses tested.
\par
We estimated the sample size required to achieve a power of 0.80 to detect a medium to large effect size at .05 using G*Power, but found that a sample size of 246 provided insufficient power to detect the lowest effect size.
\par
Normality is a requirement of SEM. However, the skewness and kurtosis of some of our latent variables are not within the acceptable range, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicates that the distribution of variables is not normal.},
